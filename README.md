# Test cases for the Eclipse API

This repository contains scripts and documentation used to test and use some of the various tools used at the Eclipse forge, including the now-official [Eclipse API](https://api.eclipse.org). For they are quick and dirty, no warranty of any kind is provided.

If you need to get serious about Eclipse data, please feel free to [get in touch](https://castalia.solutions).

More information about the Eclipse forge API can be found there:

* The official documentation: https://api.eclipse.org/
* Christopher Guindon's repository for the Eclipse doc:
