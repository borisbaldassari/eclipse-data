	Comments from JM in related email:

	Should not do this for free.  Could have a setting which made it optoinal but should nt be mandatory.  Default setting could be to have it on.
	Consider the SWT team who keep their workspaces on network drives.  This will be slow.  

	Side effects will be that a build runs when the refresh is completed unless you somehow do it in a workspace runnable and don't end the
	runnable until after the release.  This would be less than optimal as some builders may be responsible for maintaining some invariants and deriving resources which are releasable.  If you don't run the builders before releasing, the invariants will not be maintained and you will release inconsistent state.

	Summary:  Offer to ""ensure local consistency"" before releasing.

Couldn't we turn it on by default now that we have jobs, and a place where jobs show up in the UI? If the refresh happened in a background job that was displayed in the status line, people would have a way to find out what's going on and disable it if they don't like it.

	In general you cannot open a specialized editor on a remote resource because they can sometimes
	be dependent on other resources and expect these to be local.  For example, an HTML page which

6,jeem@moths.ca,2001-10-11T01:34:51Z,0,0,"IResource.setLocal has problems. This method (which replaces ensureLocal
and scrubLocal) requires some form of connection to the VCM provider,
since the VCM provider is the only thing that could make a resource local.

Indeed, the whole notion of ""local"" resources requires VCM support and needs
to be reviewed.

NOTES:

JM (12/11/2000 10:24:05 PM)
	The only scenario in which non-local resources makes sense is one 
involving a VCM.
	setLocal does not replace ensureLocal.  It is there to support the VCM 
fetching content 
	and then telling the workspace that it should expect to see the content 
in the file system.
	Similarly, with scrubLocal.  It is expected that the VCM itself is the 
one that does the 
	dirty work of adding/deleting the content in the file system.  

jeem (12/13/00 7:01:26 PM) - Where are ensureLocal and scrubLocal? They don't 
appear
in the API any more (they were there in tech preview).

JM (01/02/2001 11:32:24 AM)
	These notions should be related to the VCM.
	Moving to BB for consideration.

KM (4/6/01 3:49:13 PM)
	Only sender that calls it with 'false' is ScrubLocalAction, which looks 
like it can be deleted.
	We are not making use of this core feature since neither CVS nor CC 
benefits from it.
	I am concerned then it may not even work given there are no senders 
of 'false'.
	Nothing to be done about this right now, moving to future.

JM (06/04/2001 6:58:28 PM)
	There likely are test suites which test the (false) case.
	This is both legacy and future expansion.  The VCM model does not 
require one to 
	have all resources local.  CVS and CC appear to have a model where 
everything is local.  
	Things like VSS do not use this model.  I believe that PVCS and 
Perforce do not require you
	to have everything local but that is fuzzy for me.  DAV does not 
specify either way as
	it is a protocol.  It is easy to see both modes of operation (i.e., 
both ""I GET the whole project"" and 
	""I GET only what I need"").  
	Regardless, the setLocal functionality relates to modeling resource 
existance 
	without actualy being forced to fetch the resource.

	So, this is core API which is related to part of the VCM model which is 
not yet fully implemented.
	If you have a particular concern about the API being there, we can 
remove the it until VCM 
	implementations for VSS, DAV, ... are being done and determine that 
they need the behaviour."

S/he will then have to press F9 on the team stream view to make it include the
TS they've just created.  We cannot link the team stream creation wizard and the
team stream view at the UI level, because they might well have been created by
different plugins that don't know about each other.

Also, repository deletion is not currently supported.  By deletion I mean removal
of the repository from the list of the workspace's known repositories.  Once the
known repositories list is persistent, there will be a need to remove items from
the list to prevent it from growing indefinitely.

Some possible additional event types:

- change in resource transience.
 -create/delete project version

As a side note, you might consider using IVCMListener.handleEvent
instead of IVCMListener.vcmEvent.  It is more in line with other event/listener
pairs in Eclipse.

	Important:
	- update labels (navigator) and property sheets when loading/versioning (explicit refresh)
	- update sync info on resource change (vcm provider becomes a delta listener)
	- update prop sheet when change in sharing

The ISharingManager::load operation does not support the following scenario:

- Create project in workbench called TomCat3.3 and share a teamstream with a 
vcm project called TomCat with version 3.3.
- Create another project in workbench called TomCat4.0 and share 
with same tream stream and same project TomCat but with version 4.0 of the 
project.

This issue can be more generally seen as being about the semantics of ""projects""
in the workbench versus those in vcm. Projects in the workbench should be 
allowed
open mapping to any vcm project, regardless of the name of the local workbench 
project
that is chosen. This is similar to ClearCase's and CVS's notion of having any 
number
of local work areas for a project configuration. In ClearCase these are called 
views, and you 
can have as many as you like. Likewise, in CVS you can use the -d option with 
the 
update command to load a specific module version to a user named directory (the 
default
is to use the module's name).

The load API mentions that it is responsible for renames. If this is the case 
then if
projects are to be threated differently, an alternative method should be 
available for
renaming projects on the server. Local projects, or workbench projects, could be
renamed without affecting the repository project to which it is mapped.

Jean-Michel (22/03/2001 8:29:49 AM)

""Tagging affects the repository, not the working copy. That begs 
the question: Why require a working copy at all when tagging? The only
purpose that it serves is to designate which project and which
revisions of the various files in the project are being tagged. If you could 
specify the project and revisions independently of the working copy, 
no working copy would be necessary. "" from CVS manual.

CVS can tag (take workspace revisions and tag then in the repo) and 
rtag (no workspace required, take repo revisions and tag. This command
is mostly always used when branching 'cvs rtag -b -r version1 version1_bugfix' 
so you don't tag the team stream but ). Currently we version using 
rtag just because rtag records a tag event in the history and allows 
us to query for existing tags. But using rtag on the team stream (HEAD) is 
dangerous because you don't really know what you are tagging.

Notes:
- in our cvs adapter we must use tag where we currently use rtag.
- to find the versions created with tag in the repo the only thing to do (as 
recommended by the CVS docs): 

""Until then, there are workarounds. You can run cvs log -h and read the 
sections of the output following the header symbolic names:.""

but how do we chose which file to look into, it could be a file that has just 
been added to the repo?
- we must allow the user to enter his own tag name where ever he can select a 
version.
- we could use rtag internally when branching (creating a new team stream) 
based on a version.

BB (26/03/2001 10:31:40 AM)
	I think we should provide two operations: Create a project version from 
a team stream,
	and create a project version from the workspace. The API has both 
operations:
	ISharingManager.createProjectVersion()
	ITeamStream.createProjectVersion()
	The first one should be on the context menu for projects in the 
navigator, the second one
	on the context menu for projects in team streams (repository explorer).
	CVS has both operations too.

from Jean-Michel's comment: ""- in our cvs adapter we must use tag where we 
currently use rtag.""
	I disagree. I think we need both because CVS provides both too.

KM (3/26/01 2:23:40 PM)
	Supporting both makes for a very confusing user model.  Versioning from 
the workspace is closer
	to VAJ and is arguably better since you have a fixed state that you are 
versioning
	(as opposed to trying to version a non-locking changing stream).

KM (4/4/01 4:36:51 PM)
	Decision is to support both.  Versioning stream is helpful for 
baselining before releasing.
	Must make the distinction clear in the UI.  As a bonus, informing the 
user that he his
	workspace differs from the stream when versioning the stream may be 
helpful.

			(40704) 41.6% CVSAdapter.fetchRemoteTree()
			(14918) 15.3% Subscriber.recursiveRefresh()

			What is autoManage?
		 (12234) 12.5% in org.eclipse.vcm.ui.sync.Repository.collectResourceChanges() (recursive)
		11% in JavaModelManager.resourceChanged()
		4.3% in ResourceDeltaFactory.computeDelta()

	Hot-spots are
		14% socket read
		13% socket write
		12% String#substring
		4.6% String#indexOf
		3.6% Path#segments
		3.2% String#compareTo
		3.2% AccumulatingProgressMonitor#subtask
		3% Path#append
		3.2% String#concat

	Auto manage time (13.5%) seems to be spent determining what is ignored. There seems to be many ways to improve this!
	
MichaelV (20/09/2001 8:51:55 AM)

	There seems to be a lot of room for improvement in Subscriber#recursiveRefresh
	However, the general approach used by VCM to determine what changes there are seems to be
	inherently ineficient.

	In CVS clients, the following steps take place on an update
	1. Client sends information about all loaded files (versions and what has changed locally)
	2. Server makes one pass through to determine update reponse.
	3. Client uses response to update only as necessary
	This results in 2 to 3 passes through the project

	In VCM, the following occurs
	1. client sends information about known directories
	2. Server responds with information about new directories and files
	3. client requests file information (status)
	4. server responds + client must place file in resulting tree
	5. resulting tree + local structure traversed to update sync info
	6. local structure traversed to determine if their are changes
	My guess is that this is roughly equivalent to 5 passes

	Considering that some projects may be very large, this leads to slow syncing 
	which takes the same time whether there are changes or not.
	
MichaelV (21/09/2001 2:06:02 PM)

	I have optimized the recursive refresh itself but this has bought little (13000). The problem is
	that we do a get and write of the sync info at each node and this is costly. Furthermore,
	getting and setting get slower as the distance from the root increases. This is probably due
	to the fact that there are lots of files at the leaves. 

	Within getWorkspaces, getSharing and getProject are the main culprits. Can these be passed in?
	The project should be OK but I'm unsure of the sharing. getRepository also does a getProject.

	I have optimized SharingManager.manage to avoid internalGetSyncInfo and getProject. (from 13000 to 9000)
	However, we should not need a separate traversal to ensure that all non-ignored resources are managed!

	I have included change collection as part of the refresh. 
	(Much speed improvement!! from 12000 to virtualy 0)

MichaelV (24/09/2001 12:49:57 PM)
	
	Timings of local sync with auto-manage refresh and collection in same pass.

	100% = 30290 ms
	82.73% (25059) in Subscriber.refresh
		49.95% (15130) in CVSAdapter.fetchRemoteTree
		27.25% (8257) in Subscriber.refreshChildren
		5% (1512) in Policy.countResources
	15.34% (4649) in NotificationManager.getDelta()

	This is a savings of over 75% on VCM operations but no improvement in fetchRemoteTree. 
	Also, getDelta timings result from all the storeSyncInfo calls. One solution is
	to request only the delta information from the server as the CVS command-line
	client does.

	disabled history would not be able to use much of the functionality in Eclipse VCM. I suggest
	the following CVS specific features be added to the CVS adapter:

	1. A mechanism for defining a project version by name on CVS projects. This would be
	a name not validated until an operation is performed (e.g. load, browsing). The
	names would be workspace persistent, and allow using all Eclipse features which rely
	on version names. This resembles CVS' support for providing -r <version name> on
	the command line, we simply cache a set of -r parameters.

	2. Add a CVS action to IFileEditions which allow creating project versions automatically
	based on the version tags already defined on the CVS file. This would be easy to do.

	timestamp from the context provided by the cvs client. We would be using some of Dirk's old code that we haven't touched 
	at all for a very long time (some of which is currently not used). I hope you don't mind if I make the necessary changes on a 
	separate branch Monday or Tuesday next week.

37,daniel_megert@ch.ibm.com,2001-10-11T01:35:23Z,0,0,"The term ""version"" is confusing when CVS is used
	as repository.
	Users expect another behavior when versioning current work.
	They don't expect that what they have in the workspace must be released first.
	Also CVS experienced users might be confused. They expect to be able to
	tag a resource.


NOTES:

JohnA (4/23/01 2:16:27 PM)
	Versioning == tagging.  I expect CVS users will not have too much
	difficulty adapting to the terminology change.  They may not expect
	that they have to release before versioning, but since a warning
	dialog tells you this if you try, it quickly becomes clear.

BB (4/23/2001 2:45:40 PM)
	You can version a project (both in the workspace, this is like ""cvs tag"", and in
	the repo explorer on a team stream, which is like ""cvs rtag""). You cannot version
	one individual resource; you have to release it to the server (""cvs commit"") which
	will generate a version number for you.
	If you want to attach meaning to specific file versions, use release comments.
	This will be in tomorrow's build.
	Why would you want to tag an individual resource? Do you have a usecase for this?

DM (4/24/01 9:28:02 AM)
	1) Not every single person has its own project. JSearch for example is a package inside a
		project. We don't version the whole project whenever someone versions or releases his
		work. When I self-host on Eclipse I have to move code back and forth. I don't want to write
		down what version in Leapfrog or VA/J corresponds to some technical CVS number.

	2) Not only top level i.e. project versions and released resources are of interest. Sometimes
		you try something out on a class or package and want to keep it for further reuse. Giving
		those resources a meaningful name is crucial to find them again.

	If I can directly see the release comments directly in the list of CVS versions then this is an
	alternative If I have to click through to see the comment then it is not a replacement for the
	desired tag on a resource.
	As far as I know this is not a CVS restriction - correct me if I'm wrong. Other CVS users would
	probably also not understand Eclipses' restriction in this area.

DB (24.04.2001 11:28:49)
	I think the use of the word version really confuses CVS users. See Version Management with
	CSV document chapter 4 Revisions for a discussion about Versions, revisions, releases and
	tags in CVS.
	
	I opt to use the corresponding CVS names whenever we trigger a CVS action instead of using
	a different name that means something different in CVS.

KM (4/25/01 12:32:13 PM)
	This isn't CVS.  Its a front end to support a unified usage model across multiple repository types.
	We try to make it as CVS as possible but sometimes we can't.

	WRT DM's usage scenario:
		We only support explicit versioning at the project level, not at the folder level.
		Releasing resources versions them.  That's it.
		For your usage case, I would suggest separate projects, or branching and merging.
	
	We cannot change terminology on the fly since we must then change the popup menu
	in the explorer to not say ""Version"".
	We tried this and its even more confusing when you select a CC project vs. a CVS project
	(not to mention what do you put in it if its not yet connected to a repository).
	We decided to use a single terminology for all repository types.

	Moving to closed.

DB (25.04.2001 19:08:34)
	I don't fully agree with your arguments. It is very seldom that a user connects projects to CVS and
	CC in the same workspace. Since user either use CVS or CC it would be better to have the corresponding
	repository naming instead of coming up with names that mean something different in that respository 
	system.

	This only works within one repository though, and you cannot add a

	If the project doesn't exist in repo2/HEAD, just change the sharing 
from repo1 to
	repo2/HEAD using the Managing page in the project properties. 
Everything will be
	an outgoing creation now, and you can release to repo2/HEAD.
	If the project does exist in repo2/HEAD, do an ""Add To Workspace"" from 
the
	""old"" project from repo2/HEAD. After this, you will be in sync with 
repo2/HEAD.
	Now, ""Add To Workspace"" the *version* you created in repo1, this will 
not change
	the sharing relationship with repo2/HEAD. After this, you will have 
outgoing changes
	you can release into repo2/HEAD. Create a version in repo2 with the

JohnA (5/13/2001 11:16:38 AM)

JEM (9/10/2001 12:30:35 PM)
	Jean-Michel mentioned the idea of having the sync view always show you the
	current outgoing changes, as this information is avaiable locally. The view would
	update as changes were made to the sync info of the resources. This would
	function as a management query view, as it would always show you which

NOTES:

GDA(5/14/01 8:03:17 PM)
	This is very frustrating for users & will need to be changed.

JohNA (5/15/2001 10:37:23 AM)
	There is now a managing perpspective, and a user option to automatically switch to the managing
	perspective on catchup/release.  The managing perspective allocates a large area to the catchup/release view.
	Do you think this is a good model?  Other than through perspectives, plugins have no say about 
	where their views first appear, and how much space they're allocated.

KM (5/16/01 10:41:28 PM)
	Conclusion from usability was that it should be a fast view by default.
	This raised the question of whether we then needed our own perspective.
	Switching perspectives on release mess people up.

JohnA (5/17/2001 9:36:18 AM)
	Using it as a fast view turns out to be not that great, unless it's a really simple release case.
	As soon as you catchup or release one file, a progress dialog pops up, causing the fast view
	to close.  This is annoying if you want to release mutiple groups of changes, one at a time.

	I admit some people are confused at first by it switching to the managing perspective on catchup/release.
	However, people quickly seem to get used to it, and find it useful thereafter.  If we're just concerned about
	initial confusion for new users, the option could be off by default.  More advanced users could turn it
	on if they prefer that style.

GDA (5/22/01 12:59:44 AM)
	This is a bug in the fast view technology. It should be fixed. Check with kevinh.
	It is important to make sure problems like this which prevent your view from functioning
	as a fast view get reported to the workbench team rather than making an alternative
	perhaps less ideal decision.

	A separate issue is that the desktop is still missing support to declare this as  a fast
	view by default. Connect with kevinm. We are trying to push workbench team to add this support.

EG (5/15/01 12:49:05 PM)
	class path is a system file that captures the shared build path information.
	It has to be released so that others can catch-up with it. As for any other
	change there is a potentional for conflicting changes to the class path. 
	This means the .classpath file cannot be just hidden from the user.

	You can do either from the catchup/release viewer.  Making it just one or the other made it more frustrating
	for people.  Presumably the icons overlays should be sufficiently clear to indicate if its incomming (catching up)
	or outgoing (release).

	The only thing I can think of is to change the filters to changing the 'mode' of the viewer from either catching up or releasing,
	and then change the title and menus.  Unlikely we'll change this for June unless we find more people are confused by it.


CM (5/18/2001 2:40:54 PM)
	I understand now - I was confused because the ""other"" menu always seemed to be disabled,
	so I thought the operation was actually modal. (i.e. when you say ""Catchup"", the ""Release""
	menu is disabled - and vice-versa). But I see that the disabled menu was just because of
	the desired direction of the particular item... i.e. it just happened that I haven't yet tried to
	release something without catching up first, so I never noticed that it was possible to do both
	at the same time.

	If we are allowing both, then the initial menu item should not be ""Catchup..."" or ""Release..."".
	There should only be one menu item, and it should have some name like ""Synchonize..."" or something.

	I think I prefer the ""modal"" thing, i.e. first ya catchup, then ya release. (less confusing/dangerous)
	Anyhow, I will try it for a while, and see if it grows on me <g>.

CM (5/24/2001 1:17:15 PM)
	I still find this confusing, and I have watched SN become completely confused also.
	I honestly think it is dangerous to allow both, and I still really prefer the ""modal"" Catchup or Release
	that we had in LeapFrog. If I had not been standing there watching SN, he would have released a
	whole bunch of old code into our good team stream instead of catching up. He had said ""Release...""
	to get to the browser because he wanted to see what he had changed. Then he decided to catch up
	because the number of changes was significant. He popped up the context menu on the root of
	the changes tree, and hovered over the ""Release"" item, and (since I had just released a ton of
	changes that I did not want overwritten) I said ""Ahhh! Noooo!"" and he realized his error and chose
	""catchup"" instead. We were nanoseconds away from wiping out a bunch of changes.
	I guess it's the ""cognitive overload"" thing, that particularly hits people at 3am (that's what time
	it was, and both of us were tired). But that's when a dangerous error like that is particularly
	harmful, because then you have to stay even later to clean up the accidental mess... if you
	even realize that you made a mess... <g>).

JohnA (5/27/2001 3:49:01 PM)
	I think it's worth noting here that ""Catchup"" from the catchup/release only applies to incoming changes and conflicts, 
	""Release"" from the catchup/release view only applies to outgoing changes and conflicts.

	In SN's case, it's impossible to accidently release when there's an incoming change, thus wiping out
	all those incoming changes.  The only thing it could have released were conflicts.  However, if there were
	conflicts in the selection, a warning dialog would having popped up saying ""You're about to overwrite stuff
	on the server that conflict with your changes, are you sure you want to do that?"".

	Once in the catchup/release view, you should think of ""Catchup"" and ""Release"" as safe operations... the
	only thing they do is catchup or release non-conflicting changes in whichever direction.  When there's a conflict,
	it will warn you before releasing.  

	For example, in the most common case you have a project with several incoming
	changes and several outgoing changes, without conflicts.  You can select the project and hit ""catchup"". This will
	load just the incoming changes.  You can then compile and test to make sure the incoming stuff did interact badly
	with your local stuff.  Then, select the project and hit ""Release"".  This will release only the outgoing changes.
	If the server or workbench has changed since your last refresh, or if there were conflicts you didn't notice, it will
	always prompt you to make sure you're aware of what's about to happen."

	It sounds like what you need here is a ""forced release"" that overwrites the server without
	providing any compare?  (You could never manually compare 1700 resources anyway). 
	Would you expect it to inform you of conflicts or not?

KM (5/23/01 6:24:57 PM)

		i guess i should explain better what happened
		_after_ i'd released everything it took forever to just update the tree viewer (maybe it runs the compare engine again(?))

JohnA (5/29/2001 11:13:25 AM)
	It isn't comparing any contents, it's just comparing the local workspace with the server to see at a 
	resource granularity what has changed.  This has to happen before you can catchup or release anything,
	because otherwise it doesn't know what to release or load.  We never want to allow releasing without
	first checking if the outgoing change conflicts with changes on the server, so this step is necessary.

Kevinm (5/29/01 3:12:04 PM)
	We should (future) see if this can be sped up though.
	Other thought is that the actual tree filling and comparer opening could be taking time,
	so an optimized (just release if no conflicts) action would be faster."

Jean-Michel (04/06/2001 2:01:53 PM)
	Currently when the user gets to this point (e.g. resources in the sync view) they are
	already managed (auto-manage happens in refresh) and any means the user makes
	to unmange them is futile.

	We should think about having a context menu item on resources in the sync view which
	is called (Ignore...). When this happens a dialog appears allowing you to add this file,
	or a pattern based on the file into the ignored list. After the ignore, the file list in the 
	sync view is updated by removing newly ignored resources and unmanaging them such
	that subsequent sync actions correctly ignore these resources.

	I don't think the current API supports the unmanage method. It probably should. 

	But what happens if you unmanage a resource, and would like to manage it again?
	Just remove it from the ignore list and refresh. It will become managed via the auto
	manage from the ui."

out version in the workspace is set on an alternative branch. It begins the
synchronize process but it hangs indefinitely when the progress bar is at

JohnA (6/5/2001 9:51:24 AM)
	If you are not connected to a stream, it is impossible to ""Replace With Stream"",

there's no more to catchup.  As it is, it starts up in catchup mode by default, and once the
user has caught up to all incoming changes, it's easy to get the impression that they're
in sync, because the view is empty.

One possibility: when there is no more to catchup, but there are still things to release, 
a dialog appears saying, ""There are no more incoming changes, do you want to switch
to release mode to release the outgoing changes?"".  The options would be ""Yes/No/Always"".
Picking ""Always"" would set a user preference (also visible from the VCM pref page), so that
it would always auto-switch when no more incoming changes.

	*	A dialog is not a good idea -- too intrusive. For example do I end up always getting the dialog
		until I submit and say ""aways"" ?   
	*	Switching automatically may potentially cause people to not realize they have been switched to release mode.
		This might be ok for experts but might cause some confusion for newbies.
		
		Let me make a counter arguement - in va/smalltalk it was annoying to have to click public, then private, then class, then public, then private.
		This says that we should flow the user through things. 

		Unfortunately this is hard to tell without trying it. Given where we are if this goes in it must be defeatable with a preference.
		There is possibility this will make things nicer.

JohnA (6/6/2001 11:44:51 AM)
	So the dialog could have Yes/No/Always/Never, which would link to a user preference.
	The preference page would have a radio button group:

	When in catchup mode of the sync view, and there are no more incoming changes:
		o Switch to release mode automatically.

2.0.1.  I'm posting it here in the hopes one of the Motif developers can
put it up on the Eclipse web site or in the Linux/Motif distribution
README file.

It makes colors and fonts much nicer, and fixes cut and paste so it is
consistent with the Java editor (e.g., ^X/^C/^V).

Sadly, at least the RedHat I'm using, 7.3, doesn't have nice Motif
defaults, hence Eclipse looks pretty bad (I don't think this is a
problem under the other UNIX versions, folks in my group on Solaris
seemed to have better luck) -- and the cut/paste thing is very annoying
(Editor works one way, dialogs work another).

One would load this file with the command ""xrdb -merge .Xresources"". 
Automatic load under KDE is a tad tricky at run level 5. (I'll do up a
draft web page on how this works for KDE and GNOME if there is interest
-- if so, send me an email).

This is the most general list I subscribe to (I'm on the JDT lists only)

up many time within our group so...

	Unclear if this problem is specific to projects.  If it is, just make the failure mode better.
	That is, do not do autoload of projects and spank nicely is someone tries.  It is not unreasonable
	to say that you must have the project first then you can get stuff.  Projects don't come for free
	anywhere else.

	BTW, if the project were to come for free, would I be prompted for its local location?

	Yup, helpful message was all we were going to do.

	Recommend we catch at level of TeamStreamElement.internalGetChildren() 
and do
			ErrorDialog.openError(...)
	Recommend that class because its only UI place we can catch, and its 
already catching CoreExceptions there anyway.

	There are other places you could get this error since we lazy verify 
connections but this is the most common.

	Also, noticed that in VCMModelElement.handle() (where this IS being 
caught)
	we should not be loging info messages, only errors.

	What we really want to have is CVS's moving tag support. The goal of the whole procedure from above is, to give other

	solution that came to our mind was using streams. But streams are the wrong concept to use, since they generate a branch
	point and therefore give you write access to the stream (you can checkin on that branch).

	Is there a better solution than using streams for the above scenario.

Whenever the server is being contacted, there should be a progress monitor (either dialog or
status line), that the user can cancel.  The cancelation should be supported at the lowest level
of the client code.  I.e., the loop that is waiting for a response from the server should also be 
polling the cancelation flag to see whether to stop the transaction.  This would allow the user to
cancel after realizing that the server is down, not responding, etc.  This would also allow us to
increase our timeout so that slow connection users don't hit the timeout erroneously.

- add some projects to your workspace from a team stream in some repository
- unplug your network connection from the wall
- select all of the projects, right-click -> Replace With -> Stream Contents
- this of course leads to an error dialog, OK
- now all of the resources that were to be replaced with those read from the repository are gone

While there wasn't any real data lose here since by invoking Replace With Stream Contents I conceded
that I wanted to replace my workspace contents anyways, I was left in a position where I really couldn't
resume working since even the slightly stale resources that I originally did have in my workspace were
purged.

IRepositoryDeltaCollector method should be renamed to not use CVS-like terminology:
	- shouldn't take MergeResource, need an interface to allow plugin of other implementations.

public void locallyAdded(MergeResource cvsFile);		-> outgoingAdd
public void locallyModified(MergeResource cvsFile);	-> outgoingChange
public void locallyRemoved(MergeResource cvsFile);	-> outgoingDelete
public void needsCheckout(MergeResource cvsFile);	-> incomingChange
public void needsMerge(MergeResource cvsFile);		-> conflictingChange
public void serverAdded(MergeResource cvsFile);		-> incomingAdd
public void serverAddedDirectory(MergeResource cvsFolder); -> Remove (don't need folder special case)
public void serverRemoved(MergeResource cvsFile);	-> incomingDelete
public void unknownStatus(String status);						-> Remove this method

MergeResource can delete the following methods:
	- isLeaf
	- getName
	- getPath
	- getExtension

	replace setLabels with getLocalLabel, getCommonLabel, getRemoteLabel
	rename getLatestRevision to getRemoteEdition
	rename getBaseRevision to getCommonEdition
	remove hasBaseRevision and hasLatestRevision (can use get*Label methods that may return null.

MergeResource can now be a local class of Repository, nobody else needs to know about it.

SyncCompareInput
	- isSaveNeeded should always return false
	- shouldn't be displaying low-level warnings in performSync... should just propagate an exception
	out to the run method, which should use getProblemMessage to show the appropriate message.
	- getProblemTitle should be removed, inline it.
	- getDiffRoot should be removed -- it is a duplicate of CompareEditorInput#getCompareResult
	- SyncCompareInput and MergeCompareInput shouldn't subclass getTitle.  MergeCompareInput should
	just call setTitle in its prepareInput.
	- don't need initialSelectionAndExpansion state, should make use of DiffTreeViewer#navigate,
		this means don't need to subclass createContents.
	- collectParentCreations should be revisited.  Not clear that this is something that we should
		be doing for free.

When you add a project to workspace from a stream different from HEAD, the effective presence of a
version of the project on the stream is checked late.
For example:
- Create a new stream
- 'Add to workspace' a project that does not have any version on the stream and that's present on
the workspace
- You are prompted to overwrite your local project
- Click yes: your local project is first deleted, then you get the error message saying there's no 
version to add.
May be better to detect that there's no version before prompting to overwrite.

Step 4 creates the resource, and converts from an incoming change to an outgoing change.
The problem is, it leaves the change marked as a creation, so it now shows up as an
outgoing creation, which is wrong.

Not a major bug, basically just means the icon annotating the file is wrong (has no lower

	a file with the same name is released to the same directory the file will be recovered from the Attic. I

	I've successfully connect to the sourceforge CVS repository using the SSH connection.
	However, when adding the project to the workspace it comes nature-less and there
	is no way assign a nature after the fact.

NOTES:
EG (7/9/2001 12:24:35 PM)
	the workaround is to manually create a .vcm_meta file, release it, delete the project, and
	load the project again. However, this only worked since I had release permissions in this 
	particular repository.

EG (7/10/01 10:38:02 AM)
	VCM should check whether there is a .vcm_meta file after the project
	got added to the workspace. If there isn't one the user is prompted for the
	project kind so that natures can be assigned.

Jean-Michel (10/07/2001 10:28:26 AM)
	Indeed, this is a problem. Another workaround, instead of having to manually create the .vcm_meta
	file, create a java project with the same name then add to workspace. The added project will retain the
	nature of the destination project. The .vcm_meta and .classpath 	files should then be released to the repo.

KM (7/10/2001 2:23:10 PM)
	Its not up to VCM to provide facilities for adding the nature (this is a core/desktop responsibility).
	Our job is to ensure that the state of the project is correctly reflected in the .vcm_meta.

	When do people get to configure nature specific values? (eg. Java build path list, setting of output folder, etc).
	There would need to be an extension point that people would register with for choosing and configuring the natures for a project.
	This is similar to the new wizard except it happens that VCM is the one who is initiating the project creation,
	but others could too programatically.
	If there were a facility to call in the UI such that natures could be chosen and configured, we would call it.

KM (8/23/2001 4:09:17 PM)
	As a quick fix, VCM could prompt for project type if there is no .vcm_meta, before loading the project.
	We then load overtop."

version timestamp I have loaded (if any), and whether or not I am in sync with a team stream. 

If caring about the team stream name, there could be an extra optional 'show team stream info' menu action if necessary (unclear that this would be super necessary). 
I would rather want then a way to navigate from a project to its team stream/server connection in a synthetic view.

NOTES:

Jean-Michel (10/07/2001 11:32:14 AM)
	The stream name is useless if you are always working in the same stream but for those using multiple streams it is very useful!
	I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""version timestamp""? If you mean the version number, than
	that is already shown. Also, we show outgoing changes and dirty status for each file propagate to their parents.

PM (7/11/2001 1:25:14 PM)
	Switch on 'show version info', look in Navigator: you do not see anything useful at the project level. I would like to see the version
	name I entered.

	Unclear what value is provided by individual time stamps given I do not control these... but I guess they can be useful...

KM (9/12/2001 4:26:43 PM)
	If you've loaded a project version we should display its version info.
	We may need alternative display mechanism for those working in multiple streams.
	Or, if the project is modified since loaded as version we could reverse to showing stream name?

PM (9/24/2001 10:37:36 AM)
	All I would like is to see is the version name it was given when creating a project version. The stream it belongs to is always mentionned in the project

	We can persist the state of the editor, but it will still have to re-perform

	the local project and the team stream element that were being compared).

This defect was discovered by simulating a large project environment
and accidentally making a typo when creating an environment variable.
The problem is that an undefined environment variable cannot be
removed from a project.

The scenario in which this occurs:
In a large team development environment eclipse variables are used
to link in external libraries (eg. FOO_DIR points to a directory containing
required jars). A new developer creating a new project mistypes the 
variable as FOO_DRI and checks in their project to cvs. A second
developer adds the new project to their workspace, but gets compile errors
because the FOO_DIR variable is misspelt. The developer spots
the problem and removes the FOO_DRI variable replacing it with the
correct FOO_DIR, but when their project is closed/opened the deleted
variable returns.

A simple test case:
-Create an env. variable; add it to a project as an external resource.
-Commit the project changes to cvs.
-Exit eclipse, delete the workspace, restart eclipse
-Connect to the cvs repository and add the project to your workspace
-Bring up the project properties, remove the environment variable
-Close and reopen the project and watch as the variable returns

In the team perspective the popup menu for the repositories editor
incorrectly enables menuitems. When no repositories exist the new
stream menu-item is enabled. Since, a user cannot create a new
stream without a repository this menu item should not be enabled until
a stream exists.

    <Note by jheidebr (""Heidebrecht, Josh (J.)""), 2001/07/31 15:56:53, seq: 1 rel: 0  action: open>
When using Team to release a file to the repository if a
user decides to 'copy current change from right to left'
then the changes copied will be lost unless the user
right clicks on the editor and chooses 'save' from the popup
menu.

Since the editor does not indicate that the file needs to be
saved and the save action is found in a very non-obvious
place this behaviour opens up the possibility of changes being
lost.

This should be documented for the beta, therefore, I'll set the
defect as blocking.

Issues:
1.  We need to examine and rethink our mapping of our projects and CVS
2.  In CVS sometimes you have modules and sometimes not so we can't rely on
	them for defining a project.
3.  Taking the entire root set as projects also doesn't match how most lay out their data. 
	As a result, you must load in more than you want.
4.  Some CVS houses have recursive projects (projects in projects) but this is unlikely to
	be supported, least of all by core.

Requirements:
1.  Be able to checkout just a subtree of a project.  Presumably we'ld still need to load the parent
	directory structure and the project meta files.  Side issue: how do we know what the metafiles are?

2.  Be able to define 'arbitrary' directories as being projects.  The catch here is that you could
	not have resources above this directory which you'ld want to version manage.
	Q: How to 'remember' where the projects are?  Modules/aliases?

we have

	releasing to this older repository, but sometimes, we need to compare

	Anyhow, the gist of all this is that it can be quite confusing 
(specially given that we

	So this is a request (a plea) for the Synchronize window to show the

could be consolidated into a single mechanism that allows the storage and retrieval of this
information as a single file which can then be stored in repositories or combined with
other methods of project exchange.

Currently, each plugin is responsible for creating the files it needs when a project is loaded
from a repository (e.g. .vcm_meta & .classpath) and these files are associated with the project
and stored in the repository. The problem with this is that some 
repositories may be shared with groups that do not use Eclipse. Therefore, these files 
should be excluded from these repositories.

A central mechanism could allow plugins to register information/readers and writers (that
use XML, perhaps). VCM could then trigger file generation (if desired) when releasing
changes and file reading when loading projects. For those situations where the repository
does not contain the information, the user can be prompted for the required info either
on a per project or per repository basis. Furthermore, repositories could be flagged as
being Eclipse friendly or not to indicate whether the information should be stored in the
repository.

a generic problem at the workspace level.  In most projects people want
to be able to put all of the ""project"" configuration into version 
control.  Currently any attribute which is associated with a resource/
project will _likely_ use the Eclipse API to save its property information
since the API is built-in and ""approved"".  Unfortunately this means that
each time a property must be persisted, each instance will use their own
API and own scheme for saving/restoring this information.  This leads to
the proliferation of .cdtproject, .jdtproject, .project, .this, .that etc.
This is a _very_ bad trend.  If project properties are not always exposed
within the project, then there should at least be a toggle which is available
at project creation time to indicate that the properties for this project
are to be sharable.  This would route all of the Eclipse API per-resource 
preferences to the project local .project (or whatever) rather than into
the workspace .metadata.

Each node in the sync view represents a difference between the workspace and the
repository. Most of the actions aim towards resolving these differences in some
way. When you have an action such as ""Replace with Revision..."", it's not clear
to me whether you mean the left or the right. (i.e. it could mean Replace the
Workspace resource with another revision, or it could mean Release another
Revision to the repository). With ""Show in Navigator"", the direction is clear,
because it's obvious that only workspace resources are in the navigator to begin
with. But for the two proposed below (Replace with Revision and Replace with
Base), it's not clear whether it's the left or the right that we're ""Replace""ing.

Any ideas on how to make this clear?"

How about ""Revert to Base""?  Or ""Discard Changes"", which I like a bit more?  
(we may want to consider that same terminology for the Team menu, perhaps 
alongside ""Commit"" and ""Update"" instead of down in ""Replace with"").  ""Discard 
Changes"" may be confused with changes in the editor itself though?

Since you can't revert a branch (it keeps moving forward), then perhaps it 
won't be ambiguous?

	I thought we did this because we couldn't tell at release time what the type of the
	file and thus could not make a smart choice about sending it as binary or text.
	We chose to send all as binary, a result was that keyword substitution is only
	supported if you manually change the type via the command line.

JEM (9/10/2001 11:12:56 AM)
	To solve this problem we could follow a similar strategy as we did for wildcard ignores.
	That is, each plugin could contribute a list of files that should be treated as text files.
	(i.e. Java plugin registers *.java, *.properties). The user can view all of these in a preference
	page and add/remove/disable as he/she sees fit (i.e. add *.c manually).

JEM (9/10/2001 4:58:38 PM)

Our current API does not allow the client of the API to help the adapters batch round trips
(e.g. of course if the adapter can implement batching within a connection). We will need a IVCMRunnable interface such that the following code could be
written:

VCMAdapter.run( new IVCMRunnable() {

			IFileEdition[] editions;
			for(int i = 0; i < editions.length; i++) {

- In HistoryFilter.select, if getIsOr is true, it can still fall through to the ""and"" code.

PM (9/24/2001 10:35:46 AM)

JEM (9/24/2001 9:36:56 AM)
	Yes, but by 'the prefix of another' do you mean separated by an underscore? Or any prefix at all? The
	problem with trying to assign meaning to major and minor version numbers is that (1) they are determined
	by convention and (2) valid version numbers are determined by the adapter; e.g. in CVS you can't have a
	period in the version number but you can have an underscore, so by convention underscore separates
	major and minor version numbers. But in another adapter, you may be allowed to use '.' but NOT '_'; in that

		 Subject: False Positives when catching up with STABLE

Kevin,
Philippe's and my team are now working with a STABLE team stream.
The complaint we are now getting is that catching up with STABLE is
slow. It feels like a full replace with version operation.

Here is what we are doing:
1)  Philippe releases to HEAD
2)  once he has  a stable version he versions and copies it to
 the STABLE stream.
3) Somone from ZRH catches with the STABLE stream
 ->there are many changes and catching up
 is slow. Many of them are false positives.
 Looking at the content changes with compare
 shows that there are no content changes.

Can you explain what is going on and why we are getting all these
false positives?

Some more experiments.
When I do a replace with stream contents followed by a catch-up
then I'm getting the correct result, i.e., no changes.

--erich

Jean-Michel (9/18/01 9:08:10 AM)

I understand the reason why they want this but the actual steps they take may 
be wrong. 

> So, since the project is being copied to another stream in the same repo, we 
should be able to just release those resources into that stream 
How do they do this? There should never be a release to the STABLE stream. How 
with Eclipse can Philippe release to HEAD then release again to STABLE? I'm 
pretty sure we don't support that. The only way to move changes from one stream 
to another is to merge. 

KM>They version the project in HEAD, then ""Copy Version to Stream"", copying 
that version to STABLE. This avoids trying to switch the sharing of the project 
to the other stream (which we don't handle well). 

Assume user A and B are accessing P1 in the same repo. 

1. User A works on his project P1 in HEAD. 

2. User B adds P1 from STABLE to his workspace. 

3. User A performs his usual development releasing and catching-up to P1 in 
HEAD. 

4. User A feels that P1 is stable, he ensures that all changes are released to 
HEAD, then versions his workspace then copies the version to the STABLE stream 
(a.k.a. Copy Version to Stream). 

5. User B catches-up to P1 in STABLE and will see the changes made since he 
last caught-up (basically the version that User A versioned from his 
workspace). 

6. User A continues working away in HEAD... 

This scenario works, assuming same repo, with Eclipse 1.0 without source 
compare functionality. 

KM>>Those are the steps I believe they are following. I've confirmed they are 
in the same repository. Are we sure we aren't growing extra revisions on the

JEM (9/12/2001 2:36:54 PM)
	Impossible to do properly given the current compare framework. If we 
get rid of our implementation
	of VCMCompareEditorInput.isSaveNeeded(), then the when we close the 
editor we get the following behaviour:

	1. Editor says changes exist, do you want to save? (y/n/cancel)
	2. User says ""yes""
	3. CompareEditor.doSave() first sends setInput(null) to each pane, then 
sends save() to the CompareEditorInput.
	BUT
	setInput(null) sent to each pane may cause additional prompting 
(changes exist, do you want to save? (y/n/cancel))
	because, in ContentMergeViewer.inputChanged(), if fConfirmSave is true, 
the pane prompts for saving changes.

	We have no control over fConfirmSave, as it is a global setting. 
(Anyway, even if we did, we wouldn't turn it off
	because it is needed for the case that the user clicks on a different 
item in the tree).

	Why does this not happen in the normal (non-VCM) compare case? Because 
we enable the save actions in
	our editors, and in ContentMergeViewer.inputChanged(), the prompting 
only happens if the save actions are
	enabled.

	This code path needs to be fixed before we can prompt in this way.

	1GK79UB: ITPUI:WINNT - Compare FW accessibility issues

Synchronize view issues:
	* The tree nodes in the synchronize view need to expose their state (i.e., incoming, 
	   outgoing, or conflicting), and their type (file or folder).  Currently this information is 
	   only contained in the icon.  Screen readers don't know how to decode this information.
	* Hotkeys for traversing to next and previous difference are not documented
	* When traversing through changes, an audible beep indicates end of file... 	
		may be a hearing-impaired issue.

File compare/replace dialog:
	* spontaneous focus switching
	* no access to toolbar
	* button actions don't have hotkeys
	* scrolling through version list with keyboard is painful, because for each version 
		selected it invokes a server round-trip.

Merge wizard:
	* no widget has initial focus, can't do anything without first clicking in dialog (same 
		as import/export wizards).

Here is point #5 of my ""top ten"" that I sent to JW in email:
5 - View settings should be *persistent*. For example, ""Show Version Info"" 
should be persistent - and global, too! We have to turn on ""Show Version Info"" 
in every view, every time we launch Eclipse. Persistence is the really 
important point here. If it is not made global, then make it a *toolbar button* 
in every relevant view: Navigator, Packages, and Hierarchy (also in the ""useful 
view"", which we need to add <g>). In fact, ""Show Version Info"" should even be 
ON by default if a view is in the Repository perspective. Many - I would say 
most - other view settings should also persist. For example, ""Ignore 
Whitespace"" in the Synchronize view. It causes a re-sync, so if the user just 
restarted Eclipse, then it actually becomes an expensive operation to turn it 
on again. See 1GKDH4V, 1GFB33B, 1GKDHED, 1GKDHHZ.

Hi,

   I just installed Eclipse 0.9 build 0.125 and was trying to use it with
CVS. Well, it turns out that I use CVS on SSH using an RSA private key.
TortoiseCVS will automatically use this key, at c:\ssh\.ssh\identity.
WinCVS will allow me to use this key too (give path to it). Even Tera Term
Pro with the SSH extension will aloow me to use it either with
login/password or with login+RSA key file.

   But I didn't find in Eclipse how to do this. It keeps asking me for the
password - it should not, because my private key is not
passphrase-protected anyway. It should do like WinCVS, which allows me to
point to the RSA key to use.

   So, if you know how to make Eclipse work on SSH with an RSA private key
instead of the traditional user&password, let me know. Thanks.

The stream provided by core is not buffered, and if you follow the references
downstream from MergeResource -> VCMFile.localByteContents -> BufferedContent,
it looks like several places (such as Differencer#contentsEqual) read one character at a

the workspace. This could be wrong if someone has released a 
change, then you have no choice but accepting it then undo it manually and re-
release the fixed version.

This becomes really painfull, if the state you want to revert to is precisely 
an old one, which you have in your workspace. I would like to be able to 
release my old version instead of having the only option to catchup with the 
bogus new one.

Currently, you have to manually add a space so as to create a conflict, but 
then a compare will also see this fake version, and this is causing more
confusion. 

Why not simply allowing to release even if you think only catchup is expected ? 
Note that the same applies to outgoing changes which you might
not want to preserve (you have to use ""replace with stream contents"". This one 
has a simpler solution, but again it is not very natural.

The synchronization view could solve all these at once by simply allowing me to 
always catchup/release. Maybe if I am going against the stream,
I should be prompted to confirm my action, but it should still be possible.

The problem is due to two related problems in Core on Linux:

1) Double quotes are not stripped from the command line argument values for workspace
2) Because of quotes, Core thinks that the path is not absolute and prepends user.home 

RTP is currently looking into the original PR that was opened for this problem:

1GJM757: ITPCORE:Linux - Bogus state location returned on Linux

Providing that the original core problem is fixed, PDE will need to remove 'linux' conditional code
that was written to work around the double quote problem. The conditional code is localized in
WorkbenchLauncher. java class and after the removal, the same code will execute on both Linux and
Windows.

DG (9/24/2001 12:08:25 PM)
The bug is in the core and the core cannot fix it in 1.0 stream. We have no choice but to readme
this problem. We must indicate that PDE will not be able to start the run-time workbench 
on Linux if the run-time platform location and/or run-time workspace location contain spaces.

	Absolutely, but we are ""somewhat"" forced into not being able to support this. 
	Here is why: Print topic tree in the left panel prints the whole topic tree 
	(ie: the current topic and all it's children). In the current implementation,
	these are actually printed each as separate print transactions (through
	the IE embedded control). Poping up the ""Printer Dialog"" (for the first print 
	job for example) was not feasable because some versions (configuration) 
	of IE would not persist the dialog settings for the next invocation, and so 
	user selection would not be carried over for further print jobs.
	But I will double check this issue again, maybe it can be fixed.    

	ps: we may, at some point, rely on platform printing APIs to do the nested printing
	instead of the IE control. But we did not look into this since at the time, I believe, that 
	functionality was not there.

		Currently Nested printing will print to the last printer used by IE, and not the system printer.
		This is the behavior of IDM_PRINT command. According to MS web pages, you can not 
		programatically set the printer to be used by the IE control. 

		We can pop-up the Printer dialog for the first transaction, and following transaction will 
		re-use the latest printer, but the problem is two-fold:
		1)  not all printer dialog settings are persistent.
		2) some of the options do not make sense/ are confusing for nested printing. 
				eg: what does it mean to specify a range of pages for nested printing?

What is it

Here is part of the information I mentioned in today's call. It is flagged
by an NL checking tool (CHKPII)
but it is general problem issues with our javadoc and not NL specific. It
generated wads of other
info which I have tried to filter out and make it easier to spot your
pieces.

Some web browsers (e.g. IE) are tolerant of these errors, others (i.e.
netscape 6 on linux) are less
tolerant but I can't see us stop shipping on these.

What you need to
1)   Create pr for your pieces
2)   Fix it -- we need to fix these problems in the 2.0 stream although I
suspect some teams may want
     to address this sooner if its easier.

Where can you find the tool
     Misc -> NL Tools -> chkpii  & run it on *.htm
     Ask BrianY if you need a hand running it.

When fixed
     Please let releng know when you have fixed your problems.



Note: The above does not include pde or jdt. They will be in separate
files.

Thus an api taking a single context is simpler without sacrificing functionality.

Unfortunately, there are many situations where you may want to browse help while editing a

Suggestion:
	Break the help view into two:
		1. Help Topics.
		2. Help Editor.
	If the user selects an item within the Help Topics view open an editor.  If they select a
	second item in the topics just change the input for the open editor.  I believe this

This was discussed at some point, but it was felt that the help navigation and the html browser go together.
To address the large view area occupied, there is Show/Hide navigation button on the internal toolbar of the current help view.
You can toggle between just showing the documentation or showing both documentation and navigation.
If you feel strongly about the separation of the two views, please let me know and I'll raise the issue with
the UCD folks (actually, I will do it anyway, as previous UI designs can change). 
Thanks!

Cool Feature:
	""Lock Page"":  When invoked, the current help editor is locked to the current topic.  If you
	click in the Help Topics again a new editor is opened.  Now you have the ability to look at
	more than one page in the help doc.

Benefits: 
	Consistent mechanism for layout manipulation and persistance across desktop, including help.
	Better integration between help view and others.
	You can look at more than one page in the help content.
	On platforms like Linux, where a browser component may not be available, the
		html browser will open as an external editor.  Result: No ugly empty
		browser area in the help view.

		OK. 
		For bug 1, I *do* get the hour glass. So can you please be more specific if you are doing some 
		special steps?

		For bug 2: I have added the IE version to the pop-up message.

		For bug 3: yes, we do stack dump, but we stack dump to our own .log file, not console.
		Note that we are using the Platform's ""log"" object, and the platform by default has a global
		log listener, that will listen to us. 
		So the only way that I can see where you will see us stack dumping to the console, it would be if
		you have started the platform with logging directed to standard out. 
		And even then, it is *not* us stack dumping, we would still be logging to our .log file in this 
		scenario. It is the platform that is listening to us, and deciding to use standard out instead.

		So the point is, can you please let us know if you had platform logging directed to standard
		out ?

The help server could not resolve a path that was:

it could resolve a path that was:

			Two defects have poped up against the Help System reporting that exceptions are not being caught

			assuming that when these defects where opened, the platform logging was directed to the console.

			The help system uses the Eclipse ""log"" concept, and we do stack dump the trace to our own log file. 
			and the errors *are* being handled. But it is scaring people when they see these stack dumps (with 
			logging directed to console). 
			So I guess my question is: is it ok to see these stack dumps (of course only if logging is directed to console)?
  			or is there some standard being followed that no stack dumps should happen if things are being properly
			handled? 
			
			We stack dump only for debuggnig purposes. Since we do not use error codes, the same error can be reached
			from two code paths, and it's better to save the stack dump.
			
			Please move this PR to the Help system inbox if action needs to be taken.

many events.

First, it is relatively easy to generate a ""disabled"" version of an image, from 
an existing image. Thus, it seems appropriate to display changed values with 
images as generated by their debug model presentation, and to display unchanged 
values as ""disabled"" (grayed out).

Trying to do this automatically from the variables view has the following 
issues:
(1) Requires maintenance of a ""previous value cache"". This may be expensive for 
some clients, as we must retrieve values for each variable, on each refresh 
pass.
(2) For the java debugger, changes flicker when the ""details"" area is 
displayed. We do a refresh after a step, which shows changed values, and then 
an evaluation is performed causing a second refresh due to a CHANGE event, 
which then hides the changes (since the toString did not cause any changes).

It would be nice to hide this in the generic debug view and not have clients 
worry about implementing this themselves."

AB (5/30/2001 11:01:48 AM)

Part of the problem is that the javadoc for the ""Launch"" class constructor is missing the ""launchedElement"" parameter.   
Everything seemed to work without the element parameter except for the history processing.  
Perhaps I hadn't tested enough to find other problems.

The launch that I create doesn't know which project or resource it will be associated with until the debugging starts.   
That is why I need to run the launch with no associated element.

But, I still have a problem with requiring an element to do a launch.   
What if I want to debug an application where I don't have the main class in a project?  
Eventually the debuggee will call classes that are in a project.   Do I have to pass in an arbitrary project to get things going?

NOTES:

DS (6/11/01 12:51:15 PM)
	Ah, now I understand.  The state of the ""Add as child"" and ""Add as SIbling"" buttons
	change as you select different items.  I am not convinced that the add mode can be
	derived from the active selection in the tree.   For instance, if I have a table row
	selected do you know if I want to ""add a table data child"" or ""add a table row sibling"".
	The UI behavior would probably be more predictable if you do NOT change the
	add mode.  In my own experience with this editor the prediction is wrong about
	50% of the time.

BF (2001/06/11 13:07:40)
	Agreed.  The enabling algorithm is unable to predict what sequence of actions
	the user is actually doing.  Currently, the user needs to constantly check which
	state the 'add' buttons are in, which shouldn't be necessary.

BF (2001/06/13 10:43:04)
	There are situations when focus is given to an element, where one of the modes
	{add as child, add as sibling} doesn't have any meaning for the element.
	The mode could automatically change for these elements.
	However, for those elements where both modes are meaningful, the mode
	should not change."

superadd"", etc.  I find it strange that you insert at start.

It may also be more hinderance than helpful.  I guess I would expect the user to build

Expected Result: some sort of dialog appears with script interface.

This seems like an error to me for the following reasons ..

While creating the script action, the ""add"" dialog in the script preference page prompts 
me to select a file in the workspace.  This seems to imply that it is OK to create a script from
my workspace.  Note however that my workspace is temporary at best.  I may create, open 
or delete things from the workspace.  In contrast, the workbench is persistant beyond the 
lifetime of anything in the workspace.  If I add a script to the workbench I expect it to take
on the same lifecycle. 

Therefore, it seems strange that my script will only work while I have a copy of the source
in my local workspace.  The scripting plugin should copy the script into its own
metadata directory where it may live beyond the lifetime of any project I have loaded.

If you turn source into a script I'd say it is no longer a project.  It is now part of your
installed base.

   Subject:  2.0 - Problems with Javadoc - JDT (only)               
                                                                    
What is it

Here is part of the information I mentioned in today's call. It is flagged
by an NL checking tool (CHKPII)
but it is general problem issues with our javadoc and not NL specific. It
generated wads of other
info which I have tried to filter out and make it easier to spot your
pieces.

Some web browsers (e.g. IE) are tolerant of these errors, others (i.e.
netscape 6 on linux) are less
tolerant but I can't see us stop shipping on these.

What you need to
1)   Create pr for your pieces
2)   Fix it -- we need to fix these problems in the 2.0 stream although I
suspect some teams may want
     to address this sooner if its easier.

Where can you find the tool
     Misc -> NL Tools -> chkpii  & run it on *.htm
     Ask BrianY if you need a hand running it.

When fixed
     Please let releng know when you have fixed your problems.



Note: The above does not include pde or jdt. They will be in separate
files.

NOTES:
	BF (2001/08/28 15:49:36)
		Moving to Inbox for version 2.0

	e-mail:
		Scripting is changed to use default fonts (does not set fonts).
		So unless we see a really compelling reason to change I would recommend
		just moving the PR to InBox for 2.0.
		Using the TERMINAL_FONT in the source view may be the only place where
		we may want to make a change in the 1.0 stream (but I even question that at this point).

		There is no new API added. The JFace font registry has public API. We are adding one new font alias for
		a fixed width font and the workbench is going to provide a preference page.
		Your code would need to get it's font's from the JFace registry and listen to font change events.

		You can continue to use your own fonts if you really have to. However, it would be better if the platform
		had a single preference page for configuring the fonts. This will also make your NL and accesability work easier
		as you can rely on the workbench to give you an appropriate font for all locales.

		What would need to change in the font aliases to enable you to avoid defining your own fonts? If we can come up
		with a generic name for the font we can add it now.

		There is a font registry already defined in the workbench unfortunately for ISV's there was NO user interface to
		allow the user to change the default fonts. The font properties file currently defines entries for the following fonts:

		BANNER_FONT
		DIALOG_FONT
		DEFAULT_FONT
		VIEWER_FONT
		WINDOW_FONT
		TEXT_FONT

		We are going to discourage the use of  VIEWER_FONT and WINDOW_FONT as there isn't a clear mapping
		between these fonts and what the user expects. The notion of DEFAULT_FONT is not necessary (as you will see later).

		We are adding a fixed with font alias as well. It is expected that PDE will  use this. Investigation of WSAD
		suggests that they could also use a fixed width font.

		BANNER_FONT - Used in the wizard and dialog banner. By default this is a bold font
		DIALOG_FONT - Used in dialogs. (e.g. Text messages in Wizards)
		TEXT_FONT - Default text font
		TERMINAL_FONT - Default fixed width font."

1805,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:19:36Z,0,0,"The class org.eclipse.scripting.internal.ScriptReaderWorkbenchFile has some problems
with its use of IFile.getContents:

	- in the constructor, it calls getContents() twice unnecessarily:

		InputStream inputStream = file.getContents(false);
		if( inputStream != null ) {
			_reader = new LineNumberReader( new InputStreamReader( file.getContents(false) ) );
		}

	- neither stream is closed, which can leave open file handles on disk, leading to O/S problems.

	- the stream returned by getContents() should be wrapped in a BufferedInputStream, because
	it does not provide buffering.  Use ""inputStream = new BufferedInputStream(file.getContents(false))

	The task list is no replacement for error ticks in the navigators or leapfrog's problem page
	because I cannot see errors in the resource tree structure.

	This is a real pain if I have lots of old errors which don't affect the execution of a project but a few new ones which do.
	In Leapfrog I could spot the new errors easily as error ticks in the hierarchy browsers or as new and unexpected
	branches in the problem page.

	It would help if the Task viewer would support the concept of creation time and could sort entries based on creation time.
	This could move new errors (and tasks) to the top of the list.

KH (4/11/2001 7:23:58 PM)
	
	This is a very interesting idea. I have a couple comments. 

	Sorting is already supported by clicking the table's header item. If we were going to be 
	consistent we would need to add a field to the task viewer. The table widget on Win32 scales 
	very badly when columns are added.  The values in this column would also be of no value to the
	user.  This would suggest that we would be sorting on some hidden field right?

	One of the features that I wished that VA/Java has was the ability to reset the contents of the problems
	page so you could ignore old problems and focus on the changes you are currently making. 

NE (5/2/01 9:21:00 PM)

- the overlay editor doesn't go away when selecting another element. I'm able to continue without leaving the rename mode. This is confusing.

In the old code, column-related objects (modifiers, cell editors etc.) were grouped into
viewer table column objects. It was good and it was object-oriented. The new code
scattered that functionality into several method calls (setCellEditors, setProperties etc.).
In addition to being a step back (IMHO) because it brings us back into the age of C language,
it made it impossible to override 'activateCellEditor' on the column and provide
row-specific cell editors.

	This can be fixed in the AbstractTextEditor, however this would require
	that PDE and other editors have to copy the code.
	Moving to ITPUI

KH (6/8/2001 5:27:53 AM)
	Fixing it in the UI would solve the more likely scenario. However, if instead of deleting the project from within
	eclipse the project was deleted externally (eg. use the file explorer). The exact same case arrises and there is
	nothing that the workbench could do to solve this problem. The editor is already partially handling this case. 
	Until Core provides notification of external callbacks a full fix would be for editors to handle this case. 

	[... now we can have the discussion about every editor vs workbench editor framework handling it]

EG (6/8/2001 12:00:12 AM)
	[and the discussion starts again...]
	Regarding workbench vs. editor responsibility. The workbench should
	not show editors from a deleted project. This rule
	has to be established by the workbench and not
	the individual editors. The problem of delegating establishing this
	rules to the editor means:
	*	the API for implementing an Editor becomes more and more fad (serious)
	*	code duplication (not serious)
	*	likely inconsistent UI and strange errors situations that are
		filed against the workbench instead of the editor implementors (serious)

DS (6/8/01 10:42:45 AM)
	In the workbench this problem may be handled in 2 places: in each individual action
	or in the workbench framework.  

	1. If we do it in the workbench framework we will fail.  The workbench does not know 
	what relationship exists between a given object and the editors which may be open on it.  
	We understand IResources.  That's it.  Unfortunately, many plugins go well beyond this.  

	- Take the Package View, where you can open up classes in an external jar.  These are not IFiles.
	If a project with external jars is closed how can we possibly infer any relationship between 
	the project and the editor?   

	- Take the Repository View, where you can open up IStorage items.  These are not
	IFiles.  If a repository is closed how can we infer any relationship between the repository
	and the editor?

	2. If we do it in each individual action we will encounter the same ambiguity as
	found in the workbench framework.  it will also lead to code duplication within
	each action and inconsistent behavior between actions.  One action may forget
	to do the editor close check.  Another may implement a ""better, special"" algorithm.  

	I thoroughly believe the place to do this is the editor.  It contains the domain knowledge
	required to interpret model specific events appropriately, and provides centralization to reduce
	code duplication.  The behavior for each editor type will be consistent.  The behavior
	across editor types may be slightly inconsistent, but there are two points which minimize my
	concern in this area.  

	(a) The typical user may invoke hundreds of actions and only 
	use a handful of editors ( 1 to 5 ?  As a java developer I may only use 1 ).  A slight 
	inconsistency among 1 to 5 familiar editors is much better than a slight inconsistency 
	among 100 rarely used actions.  

	(b) The editor framework gives us a great way to provide the default behavior for free.


KH (6/8/2001 11:20:15 AM)

 	The Workbench's editor framework is ""thin"". As a post June activity it should be improved so that
	editor implementors do NOT have to handle this case. Maybe we could even get support from
	core so we can do it right?!

KH (6/8/2001 11:53:40 AM)
 	This must be fixed post June. 

EG (6/8/2001 7:12:19 AM)
	Discussed with KUM and we came to the conclusion that the safest route is to make
	this change in the editor (for now). It is important that this is revisited after June.

	the intent of *selecting* the row, it enters edit mode.  The Description field is by default the largest
	field in the task list, so it's natural that I would likely click there to select the task. 
	Entering edit mode is kind of a shock every time I do it--I didn't want that!  And it blocks me
	from using the task menu popup; gives me an edit popup.  I have to click again in another field to 
	rectify the situation.

	Since single-clicking to select, in my experience, is such a natural thing to do for most people,
	shouldn't edit mode be activated by a double-click?

NOTES:
	SS (5/8/00 1:04:29 PM)
I agree with this usability issue. I think it should be double-click to edit but I know that the cell editors
for tasklist are set up for single click. This is simple enough to change for the beta but likely we will not.

DG (5/8/00 4:36:25 PM)
Actually, our task list behaves identically to the one in Visual Interdev. They too immediately go
into edit mode when clicked on columns that are editable. Therefore, if our users have a problem
with this, that is because they hated Microsoft behaviour as well, not because we do not follow
style guidelines.

I check MS Style Guide and could not find anything specific on going into edit mode in table widgets.
I guess an alternative would be to go into edit mode only if the row was previously selected.
If there are three tasks (a, b and c), and b is currently selected, if I click on description field
of the task c, I will only select c. If b is selected and I click on description field of b,
it will go into edit mode. 

To go to this alternative behaviour, we need to:

1) Agree that it is good. It is fairly easy to learn that if you want to select a task without
editing it, you need to click on a non-editable area (for example, task icon in the
first column or file column). Adding more steps to edit may be seen as 'slow-down'
by intermediate and power users.

2) Get the support from JFace. At the moment, cell editor activation is completely
controlled by JFace TableViewer. If we agree that 1) is desirable, we need
to ask for the ability to choose between two cell activation options:

     - edit-on-mouse-down in any row
     - edit-on-mouse-down in the selected row

Finally, activating on a double-click is not intuitive. The expected action
for double-click is 'Open' and in the context of the task list, the most
logical thing to open is the file associated with the task. This same
behaviour is implemented for bookmarks and breakpoints. 

Note: this whole issue is only applicable to tasks. Errors and
warnings that can also appear in the task list are not editable.

GDA (5/8/00 5:35:45 PM)
	recommend defer discussion.   Leave as is.
	Move pr to inactive.
	
	[for future here is my comment
		* double click = bad
		* click again = ok
		* click and edit immediately = ok but is annoying at time
]

SS (5/9/00 9:14:56 AM)
	Agree to discuss later.
	Agree that double click should open file (for tasks).
	Click again would be good to edit task - this is more like when you rename a file/folder in the
		File Explorer.

SS (6/27/00 2:04:39 PM)
	You can bring an editor to the front by selecting the file in the navigator OR by adding a bookmark
for the file. Double clicking on the bookmark then causes the editor to come forward.
Filing for future consideration that the editor area is small.

AW (12.07.00 15:44:41)
	There should be an option to have only a fixed number of editors open. If that limit is reached
	old editors are automatically closed in a LRU/non-dirty fashion.

SS (7/13/00 2:06:30 PM)
	I don't like the proposal from AW. I think new editors should open in the left most position.

DG (18/07/00 4:09:04 PM)
   Why don't we have an option like Microsoft start bar, where new buttons cause all of them
to shrink a bit, but there is no scrolling. After a while, editor tabs would become very narrow,
but so do start bar buttons. You can always move your mouse to make the tool tip show up.

Visual Age C++ (Montana) used to have this feature that was user-selectable. It was possible
to choose either full tab label with tab scrolling (as we have today) and shrinking tabs where
all the tabs stay visible, albeit narrower and narrower.

Another alternative: at the moment, right button on the tab area brings up pop-up menu.
It allows closing the editor in question, or closing all editors. We could add a separator
after these two actions, and add a list of all the opened editors. Selecting a name from
the list would bring the editor to front (similar to selecting the resource in the navigator)."

jeem (5/4/01 6:56:16 PM)
	Adding dispose() does seem like the right way to go. Adding 
IEditorActionBarContributor.dispose() would be a breaking change for
clients that implement IEditorActionBarContributor. However, there
is also a standard implementation of this interface, EditorActionBarContributor,
in the API, and a moderately good chance that many existing clients would be 
subclassing that rather than implementing the interface directly. This
change should be made and documented as a breaking API change.

jeem (5/4/01 7:05:20 PM)
	Like most dispose() method implementations, EditorActionBarContributor.dispose()
should spec that subclasses may extend. All subclasses which may themselves be
subclasses should also include a similar clause in their subclass contracts."

Problem:

Description of the problem: 

Accelerators keys (Copy, Paste, Delete) don't work in any of the views 
(Property Sheet, Task List, etc.), if they are docked. 
Note that they work fine, when those views are undocked. 
 
Reason:

The Control.translateAccelerator method returns ""true"" instead of ""false"",

The only fix I can see for this would be to use some kind of ""climbing key 
up/down"" [does not currently exist!] events hooked on the shell, with the 
platform accelerators disabled [Outstanding issue: Is this even possible on 
all platforms?]. In addition, one of SWT or UI would need to model the ""if I 
am not going to handle this key, ask ""this other"" shell to handle it"" [note: 
not a parent, since the parent/child relationship with detached windows has 
proven to be undesirable.]

Additional discussion is required between SWT and UI. NE to talk to SN/McQ.

	- turquoise for low
- user does not know that 2 means normal, or that 3 means high;  wouldn't priority one for high be more intuitive?
- when you click to edit the priority, a combobox appears using the words high / normal / low
	- but you have to do another click, on the down arrow, to see the whole list

By contrast, in MS Outlook 97,
- if you double click on a task, you can change its priority in a drop-down combobox, using only the words low / normal / high
- if you configure it to show the priority in the table (View / Show fields), it adds a column showing the priorities,
  indicated as follows:
	- low: a blue down arrow  (more intuitive: blue for cold; down arrow for low, rather than number)
	- normal: blank  (no clutter for regular case)
	- high: a red exclamation point  (more intuitive: red for hot; exclamation point is standard warning sign)
- if you click on the priority, a combobox appears (already dropped down, not requiring an extra click) showing
  Low / Normal / High, with the corresponding icons to the left of the labels, letting the user associate them better

1852,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:20:42Z,0,0,"This interface still refers to elements and properties ala old JFace.
There are shortcomings with this interface because it cannot deal
with the modification of immutable objects such as markers.
If a marker is modified in a cell editor, it needs to use the ICellModifier
to enact the changes, but then it has no way of getting back the new
marker in order to update it in the control.  I have hacked around this
for now by passing the tree item in the modify method and allowing
the TaskList to compute the new marker and then slam the control.

This will need to be revisited.  Change is in TableViewer 036b [ja] 01.

NOTES:

NE (1/10/01 5:37:43 PM) Should also get rid of IBasicPropertyConstants.

NE (05/01/01 5:02:47 PM)
	ICellModifier should not be passed the Item, only the element (i.e. the marker).
	It should not have to update the widget.  The editor widget is done editing when
	the modify is called.   The task list item will be updated in response to changing
	the marker, by Core's notification.

1876,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T02:21:20Z,0,0,"Wizard errors are too obtrusive, and often complain at inappropriate times.

For example, as I'm entering a package name, it complains every time I type '.',
since a package name can't end in '.'.
As another example, create new project, and enter ""New Project"".  It complains as soon as I hit space

But I shouldn't care about this until I've finished entering my input.
That is, it's checking at a finer grain than my unit of input, which is not helpful.

According to Jef Raskin's book ""The Humane Interface"", this would qualify our UI as inhumane.

The placement of the errors causes me to be distracted from my locus of attention.
It also hides useful information (the wizard page description).
It would be better to place them nearer to the OK or Next button, since any error message
is useful at the time I go to try to use them and find them disabled.

Ideally, if I enter valid input, I should never have to see an error message, even if I enter something
invalid along the way.

To compare, spelling and grammar checking in Word aren't activated until a meaningful unit of input
has been entered (a word for spelling, a sentence for grammar checking).
Also, it clears the error as soon as the unit of input is edited again, and does not check again until done
editing the unit of input.

I recommend:
	- enabling or disabling the buttons right away, to avoid them being pressed with invalid input
		- they are far enough away from the user's locus of attention that this shouldn't be distracting
	- have a delay of 0.5 secs before showing the error message
	- show it near the buttons, not near the top, and not hiding useful info
	- don't use high contrast for the error

VA/Java actually does a pretty decent job of this, even without any delays.

external jar there is no way to automatically open an editor for that breakpoint in
the desktop.  In IPerspective.openEditor(IMarker) we query use the marker resource.
Unfortuately, this is not the true target.  It is just the storage location for the marker.
There is currently no way to identify the true target for a marker in an abstract
fashion.

NOTES:

DS (2/7/01 12:09:36 PM)
	I have submitted the following to Jeff M, DJ, and Kevin ..

Support for Non Resource Markers
------------

Problem: A mechanism is needed to map an IMarker to its target.  The target may or may 
not be an IResource.  

Solution: A target attribute of type URL should be stored on IMarker.  If this target is 
defined by a URL it is possible to target a marker at any object: external jars, repositories, 
file system, etc.  The contents of the URL can be accessed by calling URL.openStream().  
The URL delegates the implementation of openStream to a URLStreamHandler.  
One stream handler is registered for each URL scheme (ie, file::, http::, etc).  Core would 
be expected to provide a distinct handler for IResource targets (ie, eclipse::).  Additional 
handlers would be registered for an external jar or repository.

In almost all cases a marker will have a target, so perhaps setTarget and getTarget 
should be added to IMarker to guarantee their existence.

Problem 2: The appropriate editor for a target is currently determined by target type
 (ie, extension or mime type).  There is no 100% foolproof way to determine the target 
type from a URL or an IMarker.

Solution 2: An attribute should be stored on the IMarker to carry the type.  The marker 
creator would be expected to populate this attribute with an appropriate value derived 
from the source data.  This should be feasable.  If the marker creator can traverse 
into a storage area (like a repository or external jar) it can probably determine the type 
of each marker target within.  In IPerspective.openEditor(IMarker) some fallback would 
be taken if target type is absent.  We could popup a dialog asking the user to choose 
an editor.

The target type may be the file extension or mime type.  If mime types are adopted in 
core an extension point can be defined for MimeTypeGenerator's.  These MimeTypeGenerators 
would be used to determine the mime type of a URL if it is not known.   Other plugins 
could also reuse these generators to determine the type for objects outside the workspace,
like an external jar.  A possible interface for MimeGenerator ..

public interface IMimeGenerator {
	public String getMimeType(String fileName, byte [] first256bytes);
}

If mime types are adopted within core a file will have a mime type.  If so I would argue that 
a target is incomplete without a target type.  Perhaps setTargetMime and getTargetMime 
should be added to IMarker to strengthen this coupling.

NOTES:
EG (3/5/01 2:45:53 PM)
	The debugger has started to define a custom mechanism. This is bad, there should be a standard mechanism
	provided by the platform.

EG (4/4/01 11:26:28 AM)
	This is the proposal discussed with KH:


Problem:
*  an Editor should be able to render a marker in the annotation bar without having to know about
 a specific marker type. For example, the standard text editor should be able to render
 search match markers, without having to know about the search plugin.
* the rendering of a marker should not result in loading the owner's plugin prematuerly
* the rendering of a marker can depend on some other state, e.g., a break point can be
 enabled or disabled and this should be reflected in the image


Assumption:
* the rendering of a marker cannot change when the plugin isn't activated, e.g. to change
 the enabled state of a breakpoint the debugger plugin has to be activated.
* most markers have a fixed image


Proposal:
a) add an attribute (URL?) to a marker type that describes the location of a marker's default image.
 this attribute has to describe the location so that the Editor can get the image without
 having to know about the owner plugin.
b) for dynamically changing markers each marker carries an attribute that refers
 to the markers current image. 
Here is how the editor would use it:
* if the marker is of the type TextMarker check whether the marker has an image attribute.
 if it has use it for rendering.
* if the marker has no current image attribute use the default image attribute registered
 for the marker type.
Clients with static marker images
* register an image with the marker type in the xml markup
Clients with dynamic marker image
* register a default image for the marker type in the xml markup
* whenever the dynamic image changes update the current image attribute of the
 marker.
The idea is that when the workbench is saved the markers are persisted.
When the workbench is loaded again and an editor is opened, the editor can use the
current marker image without having to activate the owner plugin.

	Moving to Core for comment

JM (4/11/2001 4:22:23 PM)
	Discussed issues with EG.  EG will come back with a new proposal.
	Moving to Canadidates pending more information.

EG (4/18/01 1:18:11 PM)
	The proposal below is at the UI level only.
	*	workbench defines an extension point for registering images
		for marker types.

	*	For simple/static marker images the URL to the
		images is defined in the extension point. 
		Search would use this to define its static search marker icon.
		<extension
    		point = ""com.ibm.eclipse.ui.markerImageProvider"">
    			<imageprovider id =""...""
      				markertype=""com.ibm.eclipse.search.searchmarker""
					iconURL=""...""     
    			</imageprovider>
		</extension>

	*	For dynamic marker images the name of a class
		implementing IMarkerImageProvider can be defined.
		<extension
    		point = ""com.ibm.eclipse.ui.markerImageProvider"">
    			<imageprovider id =""...""
      				markertype=""com.ibm.dtcore.linebreakpoint""
					class=""com.ibm.dtcore.BreakPointMarkerImageProvider""     
    			</imageprovider>
		</extension>

		IMarkerImageProvider has a single method:
			ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor(IMarker)
		Debugger would use this to define its dynamic icons.
		
	*	The desktop provides an IMarkerImageRegistry that
		can be queried for an image descriptor for a marker.
			ImageDescriptor getMarkerImageDescriptor(IMarker)
		GetMarkerImage will either return the declared image or
		forward the call to a MarkerImageProvider that is registers
		for the passed in marker type.

	Issue:
	-	when using dynamic marker images then code needs to be
	 	executed from a plugin and this can result in a plugin activation.
		No plugin activation will happen for static images.

	Moving to ITPUI

NE (4/19/01 2:00:55 PM)
	Rather than defining an IMarkerImageRegistry, we could use adapters since IMarker extends IAdaptable.
	The workbench could register an IWorkbenchAdapter which provides getImageDescriptor.
	The implementation would look in an internal registry.  
	Pros: 
		- does not requiring any API changes
		- consistent with current IWorkbenchAdapters on resources
	Cons:
		- may be slower.

	The fact that using dynamic IMarkerImageProviders can lead to plugin activation seems to be a non-starter.

	To avoid having to instantiate an IMarkerImageProvider for a plugin which has not yet started,
	the registry could cache the URL for the last obtained image as an attribute on the marker.
	This would get saved with the workspace.
	If the cache was not set, the registry would use the static URL if the plugin has not yet been activated.

	Caching the URL would require IMarkerImageProvider to return a URL, not an arbitrary ImageDescriptor (can't use file names
	since resources may be non-local).
	Or, we could require that it answer a FileImageDescriptor (class name + relative file name, so it's OK if non-local)
	or a URLImageDescriptor, and the registry caches the information needed to recreate the descriptor.  
	This would require API changes to FileImageDescriptor and URLImageDescriptor.
	Unfortunately, this would also prevent the IMarkerImageProvider from doing its own image composition.

	Whenever any attribute on the marker changed, it would clear the cache.  Presumably the plugin has to be
	active in order to change attributes, although the task list can change message and priority on tasks.
	We could assume that tasks are non-dynamic.
	The registry would also have to be notified of any workspace changes which occurred between Workbench shutdown and startup
	(core has support for this).

	Another issue is that, if changing a marker can cause its icon to change, then all content providers for viewers showing markers
	will have to register for workspace notification, and update any markers which have changed.
	They should already be doing so, but it means they can't be ""smart"" - the content providers can't know which attribute changes 
	would result in an image update.  They would always have to update in response to any marker change.

EG (4/20/01 6:24:55 PM)
	Re: use of an Adapter
	using an Adapter would be the better solution.

	>The fact that using dynamic IMarkerImageProviders can lead to plugin activation seems to be a non-starter.
	in the editor case the plugin will only be activated when the editor shows
	a marker. If an editor shows a marker and is saved then it has to
	activate the marker updater, since only the marker updater knows how to handle a changed
	marker.
 	
	Re: plugin activation is a non-starter
	you are trading caching space and logic against activating a plugin.
	Given that the MarkerImageProvider only implements decision logic to
	map marker attributes to an image it will only drag in a few classes.
	Actually, the code for mapping attributes to icons could be easily put into a very
	small helper plugin. Instead of activating the full plugin only the small helper
	plugin would get activated. It would be acceptable to me to put more burden
	on clients that require dynamic marker images. Couldn't we come up with
	a solution along these lines?

	>Unfortunately, this would also prevent the IMarkerImageProvider from doing its own image composition.
	I don't think that any of the current markers are doing image composition.

	>Another issue is that, if changing a marker can cause its icon to change
	as you say clients should already do this an listen to marker deltas. 
	I don't think you have to give up all the smartness, a viewer typically is constrained
	to show as set of known-markers (e.g. Bookmarks view->bookmarks, Search Results view->search results)

EJP (4/27/01 11:59:14 AM)
	The solucion discribed above was implemented:
		- Create interface IMarkerImageProvider  (in the internal package for now).
		- Added the extension point:
				extension-point name=""Marker Image Provider"" id=""markerImageProviders
		 with the tags id, markertype, icon or class.
		- If the tag class (an implementation of IMarkerImageProvider) is specified it will
		 always call the provider otherwise the icon must be specify the relative path name
   		to the image.
		- Changed the class WorkbenchMarker so that the method getImageDescriptor calls
		the provider.
		- Added the provider for problem markers org.eclipse.ui.internal.ProblemImageProvider
		- Added the extension to return the image for marker type taskmarker.

Here's a little more info about my use case.  I was writing a plug-in that interfaced with CDT and a C++ 
unit testing framework, and I wanted to attach markers in the source files on the lines of any assertions 
that failed after the tests were executed.  Since there are a few different levels of assertions (trace 
messages, warnings, failed assertions, and severe errors), I wanted to capture all of those in a single 
marker type by adding a custom attribute to the marker instead of introducing a new one for each.  So I 
thought that IMarkerImageProvider would let me choose the appropriate image dynamically, based on 
that attribute.

When I discovered that IMarkerImageProvider was internal, I did a little more searching and decided to 
do it with annotations instead.  I created an annotation extension for the marker, and implemented an 
annotationImageProvider that casts the Annotation to MarkerAnnotation, retrieves the marker from 
there and picks the image based on my custom attribute.  This works like a charm.

So I guess the question is now, are markers now essentially just ""metadata"" for resources, with 
annotations providing the visual representation?  I guess this could explain why IMarkerImageProvider 
was never externalized, if it was supplanted by the annotation framework.  I'm not too well-versed on 
the resource/editor side of the platform; would there be a reason to keep IMarkerImageProvider and its 
associated extension points around if annotations provide the same functionality?  Are there any 
instances where annotations wouldn't be usable or appropriate?"

I would favor not giving the user control, because once you do that, you will
incorrectly guess which mode they want to use for a given editor.

Another alternative is to add to IPropertySource:
/**
 * returns <code>true</code> if the descriptors
 * should be sorted by their name.
 */
boolean sortPropertyDescriptors();

And yet another, add to IPropertyDescriptor:
/**
 * returns the integer value which determines the primary
 * sort order for descriptors. Descriptors with the same priority
 * will then be sorted by their name (in the current locale).
 */
int getPropertyPriority();

Maybe the last proposal is the best?"

Patch that adds sorting to PropertySheetPage

I talked to Nick and we agreed to prepare a patch for this to hopefully get it
into 3.1.

This is a first proposal. It adds sorting to the PropertySheetPage (and thus
the PropertySheetViewer) using a PropertySheetSorter. Subclasses of
PropertySheetSorter can overwrite the compare methods to provide a different
sorting for IPropertySheetEntry entries and categories.

Sorting is not performed in the PropertySheetEntry anymore. It's not done in
the viewer. This approach is similar to the ViewerSorter concept but does not
use the ViewerSorter class because it doesn't really fit into this usecase. The
PropertySheetViewer isn't public API anyway.


Example usage:

public class MyViewPart extends ViewPart {

  ...

  public Object getAdapter(Class key) {
    if (IPropertySheetPage.class.eqauals(key)) {
      PropertySheetPage myPropertySheetPage = new PropertySheetPage();
      myPropertySheetPage.setSorter(new MyPropertySheetSorter());
      return myPropertySheetPage;
    }
    
    return super.getAdapter(key);
  }
}

class MyPropertySheetSorter extends PropertySheetSorter {

  public int compare(IPropertySheetEntry entryA, IPropertySheetEntry entryB) {
    // your custom sorting
    return 0;
  }
}"

Well that doesn't work. A user can select multiple elements in a view or an
editor. The properties view handles this by merging all property descriptors of
the elements and showing only those which are shared within all elements (based
on the descriptor id). Which sorting should be used then? In any case it's not
unique leading to unexpected results in the UI which confuses users. That's why
sorting is a typical task for viewers.

        categories = (PropertySheetCategory[]) categoryCacheValues
        	.toArray(new PropertySheetCategory[categoryCacheValues.size()]);

	Use the Java-compiler to check configurations instead of our non-checking XML parser!

DS (3/1/01 10:50:15 AM)
	Kai proposed the same idea to me yesterday.  I agree that the enablement criteria for
	actions is imprecise.  However, we are simply following the plugin story defined by
	core.  Perhaps this will change, but I don't expect it to happen before we release.

DS (3/1/01 10:56:39 AM)
	The doc is actually wrong.  Many more options are supported, as shown in this
	code snippet from SelectionEnabler.  I will update the doc.

	String enablesFor = config.getAttribute(PluginActionBuilder.ATT_ENABLES_FOR);

JohnA (3/1/01 11:08:43 AM)
	We don't need to specify arbitrary enablement criteria in the XML, the enablesFor
	tag is really just a convenience.  Since ActionDelegates get sent a selectionChanged 
	method when the menu is opened, they can perform arbitrary enablement criteria at 
	that point. I think as long as the enablesFor tag allows for a reasonable set of options, 
	any other special cases can be handled in the selectionChanged method.  It looks like
	the code above handles a pretty good set of criteria, so the doc can just be updated
	to reflect that.  Maybe the doc could also throw in a sentence saying that the
	IActionDelegate.selectionChanged method can be used for more complex enablement
	criteria, so ISV's don't get the impression they are constrained to the set of choices
	available in the XML.

DS (3/1/01 11:48:53 AM)
	Doc updated.

AW (02.03.01 10:05:15)
	Yes, ActionDelegates get sent a selectionChanged message but only after the plugin has been loaded.
	So there is the strange situation where an enablement criteria in the xml file enables an
	action (e.g. because exactly two IResources were selected), then the plugin is loaded and the
	enablement code in the ActionDelegate decides to disable the action because other
	requirements are not met (e.g. both IResources don't implement specific adapters).
	As a result a strange error dialog pops up. Because this happens only when the plugin is not
	loaded it is quite confusing.

- open view if not open
- bring it to front if stacked
- activate and transfer focus

This is proper behaviour is most cases, but it is wrong for property sheet. 
Views that depend on property sheet normally provide 'Properties' action on
the pop-up menu for the selected object. Performing the action should ensure
that property sheet is visible. However, if showView is used,
property sheet will be activated, and as a result it will loose the input object.
In this case, proper behaviour would be:

- open Properties if not open
- bring it to front if stacked
- hook to the currently active part and ask for property source
- DO NOT ACTIVATE

I suggest adding another 'showView' method with the following signature:

showView(String viewId, boolean activate)

You can copy the current implementation to this method and
change the implementation of 'showView(String viewId)' to be

public IViewPart showView(String viewId) {
   return showView(viewId, true);
}

This would ensure backward compatibility and also handle

means that 

(a) if you perform action X in part X and switch to part Y you can no longer
undo action X.  This is inconsistent with most undo implementations.

(b) each part is forced to implement an undo stack.  

I think undo / redo should be performed on a temporal basis, ie, you undo the last action, 
regardless of the current active part.  To support this the desktop should hold and expose an
an undo stack.  Actions which are undoable should register with the stack to be 
included in the undo redo support.

If we look at the Patterns book the action defines an execute and unexecute method.
Following this pattern, the IAction interface in jface would change.  If this is not
appropriate perhaps the desktop could define an interface called IUndoAction which
has an interface similar to the following ..

public interface IUndoAction {
	String getLabel();
	void undo();
	void redo();
	void dispose();
}

I suspect that an IUndoAction implementor would contain a handle to the
action target, the action attributes, and any undo state required.

	building a project with many errors (> 1000) takes several minutes
	due to the bad task list update performance.

	This problem is severe, when self hosting you can easily create
	a workbench with many errors.

NOTES:

NE (3/5/01 6:08:45 PM)
	Problem is that TableViewer updates are O(N), resulting in O(N^2) performance for N marker additions.
	Should optimize TableViewer.

	In the meantime, try changing TaskListContentProvider.processDelta() to:

/**
 * Process a resource delta.  Updates the TaskList viewer with any
 * relevant marker changes.
 */
protected void processDelta(IResourceDelta delta) {

	//gather all marker changes from the delta
	List additions = new ArrayList();
	List removals = new ArrayList();
	List changes = new ArrayList();
	getMarkerDeltas(delta, additions, removals, changes);

	//update the viewer based on the marker changes.
	if (removals.size() + additions.size() + changes.size() > 0) {
		// Just do a complete refresh for now if there are any changes to markers.
		fViewer.refresh();

	It is only a marginal improvement. Without the patch 35s with the patch 30s.
	My test case is to load JavaUI Plugin project into an empty workspace and build.

NE (03/06/01 3:14:07 PM)
	Did some timings on a text resource with 1000 tasks, in VA/Java.
	Full refresh took ~25 seconds.

	getSortedChildren(getRoot): 6025ms

	For an item at the start, the timings were:
		TableViewer.doUpdateItem(widget, element, true): 21.4 ms
		  - just getting text and image from label provider, without setText(), getImage() or setImage(): 0.9ms
		  - difference: 20.5ms

	For an item at the end, the timings were:
		Table.getColumnCount(): 0.5ms
		Table.indexOf(TableItem): 0.5ms
		TableItem.setText(column, text): 3.4ms
		TableItem.setImage(column, image): 1.9ms
		TableViewer.doUpdateItem(widget, element, true): 28.1ms
		  - just getting text and image from label provider, without setText(), getImage() or setImage(): 6.9ms
		  - difference: 21.2ms

	The reason getText() and getImage() take longer for the item at the end is that
	MarkerManager.findMarkerInfo() is O(N) in the number of markers on a resource.
	See 1GA6OQT: ITPCORE:WIN2000 - Marker access performance can be improved

	But there's still ~20ms per item accounted for just in setting the text and image on the TableItem,
	which accounts for ~20 seconds of the above 25, just in talking to SWT.

	Most performance problems in the task view will have to be addressed by improving incremental
	updates in TableViewer, where there is a lot of room for improvement.
	However, basic refresh, e.g. when toggling filters, will still take a long time, unless major improvements
	are made to SWT.  It may not even be possible due to OS widget performance.

	As an example of what optimizations are possible in SWT, I tried optimizing TableItem.setText(String[])
	and using it in doUpdateItem().  It improved the time for doUpdateItem() from 28ms to 17.5ms.
	But this is still slow when there are many items.
	Even basic redrawing of the Table widget a few seconds when there are this many entries.

This editor is cached and reused (method 'getCellEditor' is called only once). This is appropriate for static cases.
However, some properties may change nature depending on other properties' values. Example:

PDE XML Schema editor exposes attribute properties through the property sheet. Attribute 'type' is a set of
choices (string, boolean, etc.). There can also be a restriction on a base type (for example, base type 'string'
can be restricted with a list of choices - an enumeration). Depending on values of properties 'type' and 
'restriction', property 'value' needs to use different cell editors. For a 'boolean' type, default value
can only be 'true' or 'false'. For a 'string' type, it should be a text cell editor. However, if there
is an enumeration restriction on the 'string' type, 'value' cell editor should be a combo box containing only
the list of choices defined on the restriction.

Right now, I am using text cell editor and trying to catch restriction violation using cell validator.
However, this is against the good UI design practice to dissalow users to enter invalid input in the
first place, rather than punish them later.

This would be easy to implement if 'getCellEditor' on the property descriptor would be called each time.
The implementation of the desciptor can choose to cache the editor, or create a new widget every time.
The key is to provide an API on IPropertyDescriptor interface to indicate that cell editor should
not be cached by the property sheet entry (IPropertyDescriptor.setDynamic(boolean)/isDynamic() seem
like a sensible choice). If the returned value is true, cell editor would not be cached. The default
return value would be 'false', indicating behaviour as today.

There is an issue with the help menu items that is not properly solved
in the current action set design.  

--> the menu items should be dynamically computed, based on the information
   sets defined by arbitrary plugins.

In previous versions we had a code contributor for action sets.  Dorian feels
that for the special case of the help system it should be ok to
define the action sets in the old style, and just add the extra ""visible""
flag. The only drawback is that the help system plugin will be active on
workbench startup, but in my opinion this is not such a bad thing, assuming
help is an integral part of the IDE.

If we're to stay with the current implementation of action sets, then all
the menu items will need to be known in advance and added into a help

would have to define the corresponding help menu (more like what we used to
do in the past).

I'm trying to understand exactly what the issue(s) you ran into and what 
workaround you have used.

From reading the PR, it seems to say there are independent plugins that want to 
contribute an action to the same help menu. The list is unknown until Eclipse 
starts up (i.e. until all the plugin.xml are read in).

One workaround which plugins have used in the past is to have each plugin 
declare the same menu definition in xml and add their actions to it. Now this 
has a few drawbacks (especially maintenance if you want the menu somewhere 
else), but it does work. We are looking at being able to ""inherit"" a menu 
definition from a prerequisite plugin. That way, the definition is in one 
plugin and can be changed without affecting the other plugins (as long as the 
id for the menu definition does not change)."
1895,birsan@ca.ibm.com,2002-11-15T21:04:45Z,4,0,"The issue is really about dynamically contributed menu items under Help or 
under Help -> Help Contents.
By dynamic I mean dynamic like in the context menus, where a contributor adds 
the menu items, because the menu items cannot be statically defined in 
plugin.xml files.

In 1.0 help had the notion of ""infoset"" (books) and it was desired to have an 
entry for each book defined as a menu item under Help, or as a menu subitem 
under Help -> Help Contents (cascading menu).

In 2.0, this is still a valid issue, but the workaround was to display a list 
of all books in the help navigation and have the user select it there.
It would still be nice to pick a book right from the Help menu (that's why I 
guess the menu is called Help; there is actually just one entry, Help Contents, 
under the Help menu that actually deals with help.
Since books are *computed* (not just discovered, but actually assembled from 
smaller sections), we can not hard code the menu items for each book.

"
1895,simon_arsenault@ca.ibm.com,2002-11-15T21:28:23Z,5,0,"Ok, now I understand the issue better.

Assuming no plugins are added/deleted, the menu items for these ""books"" would 
remain constant once they have been computed once correct?

One idea we are thinking about is allowing a plugin to contribute via code 
dynamic menu items in a form which the workbench could persist and show the 
next time without starting the plugin.

Lets use the debug plugin for example. Each time a debug session of a java app 
is started, the debug plugin adds it to the recently run sub-menu. So this menu 
is dynamic in the sense only the debug plugin knows what the most recently run 
list is. Now instead of doing that, if the debug plugin would tell the 
workbench, here is a dynamic action (maybe using some XML form or something) to 
add to this menu. The workbench adds the menu item and remembers it. When the 
workbench is shutdown, it saves these dynamic menu item declarations. On start 
up, it adds these back in the menu. Therefore, now the debug menu does not need 
to be started to populate this dynamic menu.

It looks like this would work for the help plugin. The only issue would be, 
until the help plugin is started, it would have no way to populate the dynamic 
menu. That is, workbench starts up, and Help > Help Contents is empty. But if 
the user looks at the help system (causing the help plugin to startup and 
populate the dynamic menu), then the menu Help > Help Contents would have items 
in it all the time (no matter if the help plugin is started up again or not 
next time eclipse is started).

One extra option would be to allow a plugin to flag it wants to startup the 
first time to populate the dynamic menu and then will not be started 
automatically next time Eclipse starts up."
1895,birsan@ca.ibm.com,2002-11-16T00:21:55Z,6,0,"Yes, I think the proposed solutions should work well.
I'd suggest a little change regarding populating submenus the first time: 
Take the Help menu for example. Right now, there is a Help Contents action that 
opens the help browser. If we want to provide a dynamic submenu for help, then 
the Help Contents action will be replaced by a submenu, where most of the menu 
items would be contributed dynamic by help. However, the first time the Help 
Contents submenu opens it will only show the fixed actions (likely the 
equivalent of the current Help Contents action), and a ""down arrow"". Clicking 
on the down arrow, would then load the help plugin, and more actions 
contributed. After that, persistance and everything else works like you 
describe.
So, the ""down arrow"" works like a ""more..."" kind of thing. 

So, when you first open the Help menu, it looks like:

Help
    Help Contents
                  All Books
                       v

After selecting the down arrow (v) or the ""All Books"" the menu would look like

Help
    Help Contents
                  All Books  
                  Workbench User's Guide
                  Platform User's Guide
                  etc.

	to be overriden to free native resources doing so is only possible by remembering all OS resource via fields. You can't write
	
		Control control= getControl();
		Menu menu= control.getMenu();		<== you get a widget dispose error


	Why isn't the method called before the widgets are disposed ?

NOTES:
EG (3/19/01 6:36:24 PM)
	Isn't this inconsistent with the dispose life cycle in SWT where dispose is called while the widget tree is still alive.

DS (4/5/01 2:50:39 PM)
	WorkbenchPart is not an SWT control.  It is a factory for the creation of SWT controls.
	If the part is closed the workbench uses the SWT dispose mechanism to dispose of those controls.
	Then it calls dispose on the part to signal the end of its lifecycle.  I would argue that this is similar
	to a JFace viewer.  In each case the part / viewer is expected to hook the control dispose and
	perform any cleanup at that point as required.

	In this particular scenario a PR has been logged against SWT.  The menu for an SWT control
	should be disposed when the control is disposed, automatically.

	I have updated the javadoc on IWorkbenchPart to clarify this ..

 * <p>
 * After <code>createPartControl</code> has been called, the implementor may 
 * safely reference the controls created.  When the part is closed 
 * these controls will be disposed as part of an SWT composite.  A part may define 
 * a dispose listener on its own control to free any SWT resources as required.   
 * If the part invokes any method on the disposed SWT controls after this point an
 * <code>SWTError</code> will be thrown.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The last method called on <code>IWorkbenchPart</code> is <code>dispose</code>.  
 * This signals the end of the part lifecycle.
 * </p>

DB (06.04.2001 09:35:19)
	As far as I know SWT they can't dispose the menu when the control is disposed since you can share a 
	menu between different SWT control (a menu is like a font). Either they must change their menu sharing 
	policy or their dispose policy.

	Since it is not clear to me that they can fix the PR I would like to reopen it again.

	Moving to Inbox again.

DS (4/10/01 10:16:13 AM)
	In my previous post I said two things:

	a) SWT will try to address this.  There has been no action so far to dispose of the menu
	automatically, but they are looking at it.
	b) Even if the menu problem is not fixed, you can hook dispose events on the control.  
	A dispose event is sent out at the start of the dispose lifecycle .. 

	class Widget {
		public void dispose () {
			releaseChild (); // Typically overridden for Composite.
			releaseWidget (); // Fires event.
			destroyWidget ();
		}
		void releaseWidget () {
			sendEvent (SWT.Dispose);
			state |= DISPOSED;
			eventTable = null;
			data = null;
			keys = null;
			values = null;
		}
	}
	
	Notice that the event is fired at the start of the lifecycle before the widget has actually
	been disposed.  According to Kevin H it is acceptable to hook the dispose event and 
	clean up any SWT stuff as rrequired, as long as no events are fired as the result of 
	your action.  

	This means you can implement your control using a standard SWT lifecycle and we do not
	need to change the part lifecycle.

DB (10.04.2001 18:14:17)
	To clarify my point:

	If I have to hook listeners for all my internal controls since dispose is called when the widgets I have created are ""dead"" anyway 
	for what purpose can I use the dispose hook. The only way I can see is to keep references to all resource via fields.

	I don't agree to close this PR since the purpose of a dispose hook is to clean up SWT resources. And this envolves lot of code
	in the current implementation.

DS (4/10/01 12:54:13 PM)
	The control isn't ""dead"".  It is only about to be ""shot"", so you can call methods to get the
	menu, image, etc, from the control directly.

DB (10.04.2001 19:00:30)
	Which control do you mean? I am talking about the control created in IWorkbenchPart.createPartControl(Composite). And this
	one definitly throws a SWT dispose error  when you try to access it.

DS (4/12/01 12:39:32 PM)
	I talked with Dirk about this by phone ..

	a) He was confused by the term dispose.  By the name, he felt that the implementation is
	expected to dispose of the controls.  
	b) We do need a method to signal the end of the part lifecycle.
	c) He would prefer to see the introduction of a new method, something like aboutToBeDisposed
	or disposePartControl.  Right now everybody needs to hook the dispose event and this
	is 15 extraneous lines of code for every part.

	Then I talked with Kevin about this ..

	a) Yes, it may be confusing.
	b) It works as is.  Any change would be breaking.
	c) We may consider this after June."

This is going to make a major impact to anybody with a nontrivial UI.
A typical UI has a lot of actions, and adding code to 'dispose()' them

like how we are introducing C++ (where you had to 'delete' everything
you new'ed).

NE (5/3/01 2:21:29 PM)
I agree with your concern re dispose(), but I don't see a better solution.
The action has no way of knowing the lifecycle of the selection provider.
Normally the client, e.g. a view, would create the action once, and unhook it when closed.
But SelectionProviderAction has no means of unhooking itself, which is why I proposed adding the dispose() method.
Otherwise, they have to do the current workaround of: action.getSelectionProvider().removeSelectionListener(action).

Do you see a better alternative?

DG replies:
I have to reluctantly agree with you that 'dispose' is the cleanest

jeem (5/4/01 8:20:00 PM) - 
Adding SelectionProviderAction.dispose() is a breaking API change, but the problem of
leakage is serious enough to justify it. It should be documented as a breaking API change
that would only break subclassing clients that happen to have already implemented their 
own public or protected dispose() method (not very likely).  The instantiation contract
for SelectionProviderAction (and its subclasses) should spell out who's responsible
for calling dispose()."

	*	Building a project incrementally is only possible from the pop-up menu. We are

breaking change for these clients. Since this inconsistency is an annoyance rather than a hinderance,
making this change would likely do more harm than good.

RG (5/7/01 9:16:10 AM)
	The other inconsistent method is 
		protected List getInitialSelections()getInitialSelections()

		public void setInitialSelections(Object[] selectedElements)

Here's your beef, Kevin.  Sorry, George made me go out to lunch.

Eclipse 033

I am writing a View identical to the PropertySheet[View] and ContentOutline[View].
Both of these are PageBookViews, and much of the code is similar.

The part about asking the activated part for its Page Adapter could be pushed into the superclass.
Subclasses (or some configuration API) would have to specify which Adapter (a.k.a. IPage)
the PageBookView is displaying.

TRH (4/9/2001 1:08:54 PM)
	PageBookView does not handle getDefaultPage returning null.  Is it possible to add this?  See PageBookView.setFocus(),
	it seems to be coded to check for null page.

TRH (4/9/2001 1:04:47 PM)
	Additional Comments:  I recently wrote a PageBookView subclass and a dafault Page subclass to go with it.
	Page implements getControl() to return null.  Why?  This should be left abstract, forcing me to implement
	this method.  I didn't think I needed to implement it because createControl(Composite) returns the Control.
	Why do both getControl() and createControl(Composite) both have the same return value?  It is confusing
	because the implementor of createControl thinks that the caller might use the returned Control, and therefore
	he does not have to implement Page.setFocus() or Page.getControl().  Actually, very rarely is createControl's
	return value used.  I think it should be void in as many places as possible where getControl() is defined, to
	avoid the confusion I and other might have.  Thanks."

	The Project References Property page should also be available on an IJavaProject.
	The problem is that IJavaProject has an IResource but isn't one.
	One solution is to make the ReferencePropertyPage class API and we will contribute
	it for IJavaProject.

	Another solution is to add support to the plugin.xml markup for specifying that 
	getAdapter(IResource) should be called for an object first before going through
	the contribution mechanism.

NOTES:
EG (4/18/01 5:26:05 PM)
	The solution implemented in the debugger is register the propery page
	against both the IProject and IJavaProject:
<extension point = ""com.ibm.eclipse.ui.propertyPages"">
	<page
		id = ""com.ibm.dt.internal.ui.LauncherPropertyPage""
		class=""com.ibm.dt.internal.ui.LauncherPropertyPage""
		objectClass=""com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.IProject""
		name= ""%LauncherPropertyPage.name"">
	</page>
	<page
		id = ""com.ibm.dt.internal.ui.LauncherPropertyPage""
		class =""com.ibm.dt.internal.ui.LauncherPropertyPage""
		objectClass=""com.ibm.jdt.core.IJavaProject""
		name= ""%LauncherPropertyPage.name"">
	</page>
</extension>

	This would be a layer breaker for the workbench and this solution
	isn't applicable in this case. 
	What we could do in the Java tooling is to register the ProjectReferencePage.
	However, this would require that we refer to the internal ProjectReferencePage.
	   	<page name=""Project References""
  	   id=""com.ibm.eclipse.ui.propertypages.project.reference""
           objectClass=""com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.IProject""
           class=""com.ibm.eclipse.internal.ui.dialogs.ProjectReferencePage"">
   	</page>

	To make this clean would require to make the ProjectReferencePage accessible
	as API. Since we will not call any method on the ProjectReferencePage the API
	is basically the class name.

EG (4/18/01 7:40:17 PM)
	Tried the above but it didn't work since the ProjectReferencePage does a 
	hard cast on IProject without checking for the IResource adapter.
	See the code below.

	private void initialize() {
		>>>>project= (IProject) getElement();
		noDefaultAndApplyButton();
		StringBuffer buf= new StringBuffer();
		buf.append(""Projects may refer to other projects in the workspace.\n"");
		buf.append(""Use this page to specify what other projects are referenced\n"");
		buf.append(""by project "");
		buf.append(project.getName());
		buf.append(""."");
		setDescription(buf.toString());

TC (5/1/01 4:48:32 PM) - this has been changed to the following

Here is another thing that will be required by people that use multi-page
editors: multi-page outline and property sheet. It is concievable that
different pages in the editor may have different outlines (for example,
Source and Design pages in HTML editor have different outlines). It is also
possible that multiple pages use the property sheet and want to customize
it, at which point they will need switching when pages change.

PDE editors have multi-page property sheet and multi-page outline views
that handle this. Particularly tricky is handling contributions in property
sheet, where Sub*Manager classes heed to be used to handle switching of
local bar contributions when pages switch.


NOTES:

RG (4/17/01 10:21:57 AM)
	Up until now our (poor) story has been as Dejan describes where multi page editors contribute
	a property sheet page or content outline page which itself consists of multiple pages.
	The editor is responsible for switching the inner pages as appropriate.
	(This assumes a requirement for a different inner page corresponding to each editor page, 
	if a standard page can be used for all then only the input nees to change).

	In order for us to allow each editor page to contribute a different property sheet page/ content
	outline page, we would need some kind of standard notification when the editor changes its pages.
	I'm not sure if allowing the editor to trigger a part activated notification in this case would be appropriate.

	Secondly we would need to modify the way we cache pages keyed on their contributing part.

NE (4/17/01 11:01:45 AM)
	Part activation should be left for top-level parts (i.e. the multi-page editor itself, not its nested pages).
	Property sheet and outline could define their own properties, and hook a property change listener on the active part.

NE (5/2/01 10:31:23 PM)
	Do we plan to support this in the property sheet and/or outline views?
	If not, DG should be notified, and PR closed.

RG (5/3/01 4:38:38 PM)
	At this point I do not want to risk changes to the way pages are contributed and managed.
	Kevin has suggested modifiying the MultiPageEditor example to use different property pages
	and content outline pages for each editor page."

i would like to comment this ""bug"".

I need to implement a form based multi page editor (FormEditor) wich has only
one editor input. The input is a remote file from an RMI server, which will
allready be cached lazily in local workspace by the input itself, if some
document provider requests the source file of the input. One page is a
nested Text-Editor which shows the ""raw"" text-data.

It would be very usefull if a standard mechanism would give the ability
to contribute multiple outline pages for an multi-page-editor, maybe something
like a container of pages for every nested editor or form-page.
...Or in common, the workbench should (optional) request outline-pages from
every form-page/editor-part and provide a standard implementation which handles
the switch between the inner-outline-pages.

at all?

The MPE would need to delegate the getAdapter implementation for the
IOutlinePage.class case to the active nested editor, but there would also need
to be some kind of (indirect) notification back to the outline view when the
nested page changes so it can re-request the page to show.

Also, currently the Outline view assumes that a given part (i.e. outer editor)
supplies only a single page, and caches this.  So either this assumption needs
to be relaxed, or it needs to know about the nested editor.  It may also be the
case that you want to show an outline for a tab that is not editor-based.

1920,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T02:22:19Z,0,0,"The accelerator and text of an action cannot be set independently.

This is problematic for global actions in the Eclipse UI, since handlers can change the text, but the workbench
should define the accelerator.  Currently handlers must re-specify the accelerator in the text.
There is also no way of getting the textual representation of the accelerator, only the SWT keycode.

The accelerator should be a separately settable property, with conveniences for converting from
the textual representation to the SWT keycode, and vice-versa.

Customer's original request:
RH:
I am updating the Undo Action's label, for example, ""undo delete"".
If I do this, it resets the accelerator.  How do I avoid resetting the acclerator?
And, In the case of Undo, when our action is actually wrapped by the real UndoAction,
is our accelerator being used, or just that of the Global UndoAction?

NE:
Action.setText() is used to set the accelerator as well.  Since global
action handlers simply propagate their setText() to the ""real"" action, the
accelerator (and mnemonic) are passed on (or lost if not specified by the handler).
By default, undo and redo use ""&Undo@Ctrl+Z"" and ""&Redo@Ctrl+Y"" for their text.

You should include both the mnemonic and the accelerator in the text, as
follows:

undoAction.setText(""&Undo Delete@Ctrl+Z"");
redoAction.setText(""&Redo Delete@Ctrl+Y"");

You might also want to set the tool tip text.

RH:
Why is the accelerator not a separate proprety from the label?
Anyway, we are trying to parse the old label's accelerator and restore it.

If I call getText, will I get the ""@Ctrl+Z"" portion, or just Undo?

NE:
Unfortunately, the accelerator portion is stripped when it is set, so getText() would return ""&Undo"", not ""&Undo@Ctrl+Z"".
There is no way of getting the accelerator for a global action.

Note that there is a getAccelerator() method on Action, but this returns the SWT key code, and there is no API to convert this to the textual representation.
However, getting the accelerator on your handler will not return the accelerator of the actual global action.

I have filed two PRs for these issues: 
1GCDU59: JFUIF:ALL - Actions should have accelerator as separate property
1GCDW98: ITPUI:ALL - Need way of getting accelerators for global actions

For now, I recommend just hard-coding ""@Ctrl-Z"" and ""@Ctrl-Y"" for your undo and redo handlers.


NOTES:

NE (4/18/01 10:25:33 AM)
	Should add setAccelerator(int) to IAction and Action.
	Should change setText() to not change accelerator if not specified.
	Should add static methods on Action:
		int acceleratorTextToKey(String acceleratorText)
		String acceleratorKeyToText(int)

NE (4/18/01 12:35:47 PM)
	RH proposes:

Action.setText(String) and Action.getText() are not symmetrical.
""@"" it being converted to a TAB, and ""&"" is getting lost.

We are implementing UndoAction.getTooltipText() to return getText(), but
then the
Tooltip has the accelerator on it.  This doesn't make any sense to me.

I would prefer that  ""text"" be an entirely separate property from
accelerator
(and possibly mnemonic).  getText() might return just the Text, no
accelerator.

It is probably too late to make this type of change, but this could be
simulated
by changing the semantics of setText().  setText() could parse the
accelerator
if present, but leave it alone if not present.

So, the accelerator would not be changed when calling:
     CASE 1: setText(""Undo delete"")

To really set the accelerator to null, I would call:
     CASE 2: setText(""Undo delete@"")

One could argue that the mnemonic should always be set with the text, so I
think having to call:
     CASE 3: setText(""&Undo delete"")
is perfectly acceptable.

To be considered separately, getText() could return just the text, without
the accelerator at the end.
ActionContributionItem would have to be changed accordingly when it updates
a MenuItem.

NE (4/18/01 1:13:02 PM)
	Made suggested workarounds.  See: 
		1GCE23H: JFUIF:ALL - Accelerator should not be reset if not specified in text
		1GCE25G: JFUIF:ALL - Action.getText() should return what was set in setText()

NE (5/2/01 10:32:52 PM)
	Should make accelerator separate property.
	Should have way of converting to/from printable representation.
	However, too late to make these API changes.

	An IRunnableContext supports to run a runnable forked:
		public void run(boolean fork, boolean cancelable, IRunnableWithProgress runnable) throws InvocationTargetException, InterruptedException {
	When run in forked mode the runnable is executed in a separate ModalContext thread and the UI is blocked from input.
	When forked is false then the operation is run in the UI thread. This means the UI isn't responsive while the runnable is
	executing. 

	Since the JFace restructuring most of the code was run with fork=false and this resulted in PRs since the UI wasn't repainting. 
	This got addressed by turning the fork to true. However, this is no longer trivial since the code now has to
	be aware that it isn't running in the UI thread. Notice, that in the old JFace there were some smarts in dialogs that
	took some of this burden from the user. 

	We have attempted to switch to fork=true in the Java UI. Posting dialogs from another thread is still doable with

	private int openDialog(final Dialog dialog) {

	JFace text is consistent with JFace and assumes it is accessed in the UI thread only.

	Issues:
	- 	there should be a huge WARNING in IRunnableContext about the consequences of 
		using forked=true
	- 	there needs to be recommendations for how ISVs handle forked=true, e.g. how to
		post dialogs.
	- 	the Document modification problem could be addressed by making the Document
		aware that it can be accessed from a non-UI thread. However, this would be 
		inconsistent with the rest of JFace.
	-	without a better story for forked=true clients will fall back to forked=false which

I'm begining to seriously evaluate Eclipse, in order to find if it is my

For an IDE to be my perfect IDE, it has to run and be usable on all of my
computers.
Including my little Vaio (PCG-C1VE, great in the train).
That is, it has to work with a 1024x480 screen.
The workbench is OK, the wizards are not always.
I don't know (yet) if it can be managed in a general way, or if it depend
of each plugin, but a detection of screen size seem to be missing, and

Almost everyone is now familiar with forward/back arrows in the context of browsing the web, and our use of them (in the main coolbar) matches peoples expectations (including having historical context in a drop down). These, plus the pop up based navigation mechanisms (Open Type, Quick Type Hierarchy, Quick Outline, etc.), have made navigating around in a large data space relatively easy in Eclipse.

The only other value of the ""Go Into"" support was to make only a subset of the content viewable. The working set support in Eclipse can also be used to do this. Setting a working set that matches the content is both more flexible than ""Go Into"", and shows the ""parent nodes"" in the tree, which gives you the context you were looking for. Unfortunately, the workflow around setting/clearing working sets is still somewhat clunky. If we could fix *that*, I would argue that it's time to remove ""Go Into"" and the associated arrows."

A project is broken down into segments that are represented by an IFolder. Each user works on an IFolder. They use the navigator ""go into"" feature to isolate themselves from others work.

Extremely large projects could involve a few thousand IFolders and take 12 to 18 months to complete. Anything that helps reduce the number of files in the navigator view is greatly appreciated by our users.

I would love to see the working sets API improved so our user community would use it more but even with that the ""go into"" is still a fast/easy way to isolate an IFolder.

Look and feel issues:
	- use filter selection dialog instead of multiple toolbar buttons
	- provide single toolbar button and popup menu item (""Filter..."") to 
open filter selection dialog
	- indicate whether filters are active in title 
Extensibility issues:

	- allow filtering based on plugin (?)
	- allow different marker types to be shown (types other than PROBLEM 
and TASK and their subtypes) (?)
	- allow different attributes (columns) to be shown (?)

Related look and feel issues:
	- allow columns to be selectively shown or hidden

Executive summary:
=================

Will add a filter dialog, to replace buttons in toolbars.
Will add a single toolbar button and menu item to open filter dialog.
Filter dialog will have the following layout.  The buttons in the top half are 
all toggles.

	[X] Show Tasks   [ ] Show Completed Tasks (disabled if Show Tasks is 
unchecked)
	[X] Show Errors
	[X] Show Warnings
	[X] Show Infos
	[ ] Other (enables section below, and disables buttons above)
	------------
	Show entries of type: [combo box for marker type]  (e.g. All Types, 
Problem, Task, and registered subtypes)
	Where description contains: [text box]
	[ ] Where severity is: [combo box for severity] (disabled if checkbox 
at left is unchecked, or if non-Problem type selected)
	[ ] Where priority is: [combo box for priority] (disabled if checkbox 
at left is unchecked, or if non-Task type selected)
	[ ] Where completion status is: [combo box for completion status] 
(disabled if checkbox at left is unchecked, or if non-Task type selected)

Prerequisites:
	- Core must provide human-readable names for marker types.

Will not support:
	- filtering based on plugin
	- different marker types to be shown in task view
	- different attributes (columns) to be shown 

To be determined:
	- allow columns to be selectively shown or hidden


More background:
===============

It is straightforward to use a filter selection dialog instead of the multiple 
toolbar buttons.
The interesting issue is how to make it extensible.
A limited way would be for the dialog to allow you to choose which marker type 
to show.
However, this doesn't provide enough granularity.  
Currently the task view shows only PROBLEM and TASK marker types, and their 
subtypes.
Problems are divided into errors, warnings, and infos based on the value of 
their SEVERITY attribute.
So we want to filter based on different attribute settings, in addition to the 
marker type.


However, with minor improvements to what we have now, we could have a dialog 
which lets the user
- choose marker type criteria
	- marker type chosen from all registered types
	- conditions: equals, not equal to, is a (i.e. is subtype of), is not a
- choose 0 or more attribute criteria
	- attribute chosen from available ones supported by selected type (+ 
inherited ones if applicable)
	- conditions: equals, not equal to, exists, does not exist, contains 
text, doesn't contain, is at most, is at least, is more than, is less than, is 
between
	- conditions apply to all supported value types (String, Integer, or 
Boolean)
		- if we declared type of attribute in XML as either String, 
Integer, or Boolean, we could be more selective on which conditions are shown
- would still need human-readable descriptions for marker types and attributes

One problem with this is that, since we don't support enumeration types, 
frequently used attributes like SEVERITY and PRIORITY are integers,
and the parameter to match would have to be specified as an integer, which has 
no meaning to the user.
E.g. the user should not have to know that Error severity is equal to 2.
We could also describe the allowed values for an enumeration attribute in XML, 
but this is starting to add more semantics to the XML than we would like.

A more closed form solution would be:
- choose marker type criteria as above
- choose 0 or more attribute criteria
	- attribute chosen from hardwired set (currently supported ones)
	- since they're hardwired, we can have combo boxes for enum attributes 
(SEVERITY, PRIORITY, DONE)
- the UI could be tailored to the fixed set of attributes, rather than generic
- see executive summary above for proposed layout

Other task view extensibility issues (not directly related to filtering):
- do we want to allow different kinds of markers to be shown, other than 
PROBLEMs and TASKs?
	- could provide an extension point for which types are shown
	- only registered types and their subtypes would be shown
- do we want to allow different attributes to be shown?
	- defined by registered types and/or subtypes

The ""delete"" action always targets the active part.  If you activate the navigator and
then click on a file, the delete action will be enabled.  If you click onto another part
without a selection provider the ""delete"" action is disabled.  It is targetted to the
new part.

Now create a global action in an action set.  It should be enabled for type IFile, and
label it ""delete too"".  If you activate the navigator and
then click on a file, the delete action will be enabled.  If you click onto another part
without a selection provider the ""delete"" action is NOT disabled, because the plugin action
does not receive notification of the new selection.  It is still targetted to the selection
in the old part.

NOTES:

DS (4/25/01 11:36:18 AM)

The current behavior of ISelectionService as implemented in the workbench is faulty. 

	- If getSelection is called when the active part does not have a selection provider getSelection 
	returns null. 
	- If the user activates a part with a selection provider a selectionChanged event will 
	be fired containing the part selection.  
	- If the user activates a part without a selection provider a selectionChanged
	event will not be not fired. 

This leads to an inconsistenty.  The return value for getSelection has changed, but no event was fired.

To resolve this I would like to fire a selectionChanged event whenever the active part 
changes.  If the active part is a selection provider we will pass the part selection.  If not 
we will pass null in selectionChanged.  This indicates that the selection is ""undefined"" ( the 
part may have a selection but is just not publishing it ).  In either case selection listeners are 
notified when a change of selection occurs, and listeners always know the latest value of 
getSelection.

jeem (5/4/01 6:22:38 PM) - API-wise,
ISelectionListener.selectionChanged(IWorkbenchPart, ISelection) already specifies that
selection may be null. I recommend adding an explanation to ISelectionService re: when
listeners will be notified."

1941,unknown63@eclipse.org,2001-10-11T02:22:43Z,0,0,"The title of the workbench has the format ""Perspective - Eclipse Workbench"".  
The 
perspective name defines ""how"" I'm looking at information, but not ""what"".  In 
my 
mind ""what"" is just as or more important than ""how"" (justification below).  
Hence, I think
the window title should be ""ProductName - Input : Perspective"", or something 
similar.  

Justification:

1. Start the workbench with the default perspective. You're looking at ""the 
workspace, 
	or everything"" with the ""Resource Perspective"".  The title 
says ""Resource - Eclipse Workbench"".  
2. Create two projects in the navigator.  
3. Select one and invoke ""Open in New Window | Resource"".  A new window will 
open
	on the selected project.  This is an important feature, because it 
allows scoping and 
	increases the scalability of the project.  The title of the new window 
is ""Resource - 
	Eclipse Workbench"".  
4. Go back to the first window.
5. Select the second project.  Invoke  ""Open in New Window | Resource"".  A new 
window
	will open.  

Now you have 3 windows which all have the same caption, but clearly they 
present different 
information.  The titles are useless.  This problem also occurs when you create 
3 pages
within a single window.

To resolve this I think the titles should be ..

Workspace ( or some other term, maybe All, or * ) : Resource Perspective
Project 1: Resource Perspective
Project 2: Resource Perspective

NOTES:
EG (5/1/2001 9:18:54 AM)
	I would also like to see the input element in the title.
	When changing the title format keep in mind that the most 
distinguishing information
	is in the front this allows you to distinguish the windows in the short 
cut bar.
	Having all windows start with Product name would make them only 
distinguishable by
	the icon. The last proposal makes more sense to me."

RH requests:

I have a suggestion for a future release of the Workbench regarding Editor
contributors.
Rather than having the workbench define that there will be one instance of
a contributor per
Editor type per Workbench window, let the Editor itself determine how many
instances there
should be.  This would be analogous to asking the Editor for its
ContentOutline page, which
is what currently happens, versus defining the ContentOutline page in XML.

Some editors could return a reused instance of a contributor, whether there
is just one per workbench Page
or one for all of the workbench would depend on the Editor.  Some editors
might want a new contributor
instance for each instance of an editor.  By using
getAdapter(IActionBarContributor), the Editor could
decide.

Randy Hudson

P.S.  This solution could even be phased in without affecting client code.
Since unknowning Editors will
return null for getAdapter(), the workbench could revert to the current
style of looking for a plugin extension
in plugin.xml

	opened in another page. Whether  it should be saved depends on isSaveOnCloseNeeded().

Note: apply this at your own risk. I just made it up, and I don't entirely understand what I am doing.

Basically, the workaround in bug 54387 does not work any more because the XML file you need to edit is hiding inside a .jar file. Just uncompress that jar file (Eclipse does not care), then you can edit the config file.

On my Ubuntu Linux system, the step-by-step procedure is:

1. Ensure that Eclipse is not running. 

2. As root, run the following commands:

# cd /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins
# unzip org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.1.jar -d org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.1
# mv org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.1.jar org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.1.bak

3. Edit the file /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.1/plugin.xml

Find the bit of this file that looks like 

   <extension
         point=""org.eclipse.ui.ide.resourceFilters"">
      <filter
            selected=""false""
            pattern="".*"">
      </filter>
   </extension>

Make as many copies of the <filter> tag as you like, and change the pattern attributes to be what you want them to be.

4. Run Eclipse again, while keeping your fingers crossed.

	this case. When you were working with the palette, it was above the editor. Once your
	mouse left (or it may have required you click on the editor again), the palette would
	move below the editor (in the Z-order that is). When the mouse entered the palette
	and hovered for a specific amount of time at the same place, the palette came to the
	top...without the user clicking on it.

NOTES:
	RG (5/1/01 3:52:04 PM)
	I'm certain this functionality was added for the Tech Preview so somewhere along the line it has gotten lost.
	It is not enough for the preferece dialog to save its store since each of the individual pages may have their
	own store.
	I believe the dialog used to get the strore from the pages and do a if (needsSaving) save call.
	We can no longer do this because the dialog deals with IPreferencePages not PreferencePages.
	The best solution would be to add a saveStore method to IPreferencePage.
	In addition we need to add a save method to IPreferenceStore (it already has needsSaving).
	Although these are breaking API changes I suspect no one will actually be affected since
	we will implement the methods in PreferencePage and PreferenceStrore and I suspect
	everyone is using these implementations.

	Proposed fix (not released) in:
	PreferenceStore :: org.eclipse.jface.preference 0.101 [rg] 01
	PreferencePage :: org.eclipse.jface.preference 0.101 [rg] 01
	PreferenceDialog :: org.eclipse.jface.preference 0.101 [rg] 01
	IPreferenceStore :: org.eclipse.jface.preference 0.101 [rg] 01
	IPreferencePage :: org.eclipse.jface.preference 0.101 [rg] 01

RG (5/4/2001 6:04:26 PM)
	Transferred these class versions to the new repository

jeem (5/4/01 7:53:35 PM)
The minimal breaking API changes would be to
	- clients who implement IPreferencePage directly
	- clients who implement IPreferenceStore directly
This is possible, although it seems more likely that clients are subclassing
the standard implementation PreferencePage and PreferenceStore.
Since the problem is severe enough, the change should proceed and
document as a breaking API change.

A client that is currently reimplementing PreferenceDialog.handleSave()
to save the preferences (as recommended in old javadoc comment) would
not be calling the new method implementation. If all clients should only
extend but not reimplement this method, this would be an additional
breaking API change and should be documented as such. If, on the other hand, 
it's fine for a client to reimplement, then this is not a breaking API change.

jeem (5/4/01 7:48:45 PM) - Specific comments on version 0.101 [rg] 01
- Comment for PreferencePage.saveStore() should be non-javadoc and
	refer to IPreferencePage.
- Javadoc comment for PreferenceDialog.handleSave() should either
(a) allow subclasses to override as before, or (b) allow subclasses to
extend only."

buttons for filtering (e.g. Java contributes a hide/show final action).
If multiple languages do this, then this clutters the view toolbar, but the user typically
only works on a single language at a time.

Also, this might help control WSA's toolbar situation (currently 64 actions contributed to toolbar).

Headline:  Import: Select Type does not select anything 
  
 Description:  In the import wizard, the Select Type button does not select anything. 

STEPS TO REPLICATE: 
- select File->Import 
- select File System for import source and press Next 
- enter a directory with subfolders and files (eg. WINNT) 
- press Select Types 
- in the Select Types dialog, press Select All and press OK 

Result: 
- Nothing was selected in main wizard 

Expected result 
- All the files with the file extensions in Select Types should be selected. 

 NOTE: Select Types only filters the selected files if all the files were already selected.

NOTES:
ARCH (7/18/01 7:04:25 PM)
	Investigate for 1.0.
	Fix only if trivial.

TC (7/23/01 3:43:06 PM) - this was a design decision for import. Select types is a filter on the 
existing selections and will not query files that are not selected for efficiency reasons.

TC (7/24/01 9:50:43 AM) - I think a rename of the button for the import dialog like Filter Types
would be less confusing

NE (08/09/01 12:02:28 PM)
	A better solution is to make Select Types actually select the chosen types.
	Since this may lead to significant work by the UI, it should use a cancelable progress monitor
	(also for Select All case, or even checking individual items).
	Renaming the button for 1.0 is not very tasty, since the UI would likely change back for 2.0,
	with progress monitoring and cancelation added.
	Should just document the problem in README."

	Pls talk to me before you make changes. 

SA (5/18/2001 3:53:44 PM)
	After talking with the Core team and Eclipse Java IDE team, here are some of the issues:

	- Everyone is ok with the words Build and Rebuild All. So I see no need to rename these. Woo Hoo!!!

	- What is leading to confusion is the menu name Project. Everyone seems to think it maps to the
	current selected project in your navigator! So they assume Build and Rebuild All apply to the
	selection. What we need is a new name for this menu so it is less confusing (I'd be interested what
	the usuability tests say). Workspace cannot be used unfortunately. Any suggestions? It could be
	Projects (with an ""s"" at the end)?

	- It seems most people turn off auto build... I've not asked why yet...

	- Everyone wants a shortcut to do a manual incremental build of the CU. Right now, hitting Ctrl+B
	causes the incremental build to run on all projects. Therefore, you need to find the project, popup
	its menu, and select Build - quite painful and causes you to scroll the navigator around a lot. The
	package view adds ""Build Project and Rebuild Project"" to the file and folder popup menu... not so
	sure I like that idea. What if we had a menu item in the File menu to do a Build with Ctrl+B as the
	accelerator. It would be enabled when an editor is open. We could also change the Build toolbar
	icon to also enable/disable on an editor being open? That way people get the shortcut to build the
	project in which the current editor input belongs to.

	- Some disagree with the Build menu item in the Project menu being removed when Auto build is
	turned on. We should only disabled it instead. I defer to the usuability experts on this one...

	Issue number 4 (shortcut to do project build) is what everyone seem to be complaining about.
	Maybe if people used auto build more this would not be such a big deal."

keys, namely that you get stuck in a cell editor.

Key navigation has been changed such that arrow up/down will move you up/down 
without activating a cell editor.  Pressing enter on a cell editor will 
activate it.  You can then either press enter or tab in the cell editor to 
accept the change, or escape to cancel.  Arrows can then be used to navigate 
up/down appropriately.  Arrow right/left expand/collapse the tree.

Tab navigation cycle between the view, its folder tab, and the toolbars.

Attached is a patch that would allow tab navigation if in the future we decide 
to pursue this avenue.  Note this algorithm provides the same functionality 
already provided by arrow key navigation.

I believe yes. I am but the conveyor of information that DT obtained from JK. 
All I did was
create the prs<g> - no value add.

I believe I saw a newsgroup post by rational asking for child tasks and it may 
provide additional
info & I think kevinh may also have seen it.

If you need additional info we can go back to them and ask.

- 'Java'  ---> open type
- 'Project' --> build/rebuild
- 'Window' ---> preferences

The menu organization seemed better in VAJ. I like the 'Selected' one, which I am missing now.
I feel that the perspective menu should rather be merged with the 'Window' one, where perspectives could simply appear as
window layouts. At least the 'Window' menu could have 3 different sub-items:

Window/Preferences
Window/Perspectives
Window/Show View/...

In the 'Java' menu, why aren't the various toolbar options available as well (search for example).

Also having a hook to the VCM (like the management query tool in VAJ) would be nice.

NOTES:

PM (5/7/2001 5:47:02 PM)
	I also dislike the fact I have to indirect through 'Others...' in general in the menus, so as to get to non generic elements (which I will likely
	never use when doing Java stuff). In the Java world, the defaults should be Java elements, the rest could be reachable through Others...

EG (5/8/2001 11:40:43 AM)
	In the Java perspective you don't have to go through Others. You currently have to go through others for the Open To actions,
	but this will be fixed in the next workbench build input.

compile N files. However, in cases where the operation is going through several
main tasks, each having its own subtasks, it is probably better to list all the 
main tasks in advance,
and then draw a checkmark in front of each task text as it has been completed.
Progress indicator can still be used to show progress within each of the main
tasks.

I didn't check IProgressMonitor in detail, but it should be flexible enough
to acommodate this implementation without changes.

Of course, for this kind of monitor to work, there should not be more than a few
main tasks. Otherwise, the indicator will be too tall.

It's debatable whether the user really cares if it's out of synch.  There's only ever one copy of the contents anyway.

For issues related to opening editors, see 1GDFD96: ITPUI:WIN2000 - Need to sort out handling of out-of-synch resources
There are other issues with copy/move, etc.

Many moons ago, when I was still on the Core team, you told me the way you thought this should work, but I've unfortunately forgotten the details.
For opening editors, I'm inclined to just do a refresh local, without prompting the user.  There's only one copy of the content anyway.
My only hesitation is that this is a workspace modification, and will trigger a build when opening an editor on an out-of-synch file.

For saves, it should prompt whether to overwrite, or to refresh.  It would be nice to be able to compare changes too.
Neither overwriting or refreshing is too tasty though, since changes are lost either way.  
Is there any way we can leverage the local history or the recycle bin to avoid permanently losing changes?

If you're too busy, just let me know and I'll go ahead with my proposal above.  It may be suboptimal, but it will be better than what we have currently."

	Problem is due to a thread suspend trying to switch to the debug perspective. 

JGS (5/30/01 10:10:40 AM)
	Unsetting ""switch to debug perspective"" preference does not eliminate flicker.

JGS (5/30/01 12:20:02 PM)
	Check for DebugEvents in DebugView.  Maybe an extra one, or maybe a stray 'change' event.

JGS (5/31/01 10:59:22 AM)
	Looks like an AbstractTreeViewer problem.

JGS (5/31/01 11:37:02 AM)
	Steps to reproduce:
	-	Launch some simple program in debug mode with a breakpoint set
	-	When breakpoint is hit, swipe some variable and right-click 'Inspect'
	-	Carefully watch DebugView, and notice flicker
	
	In AbstractTreeViewer.updatePlus(), set a breakpoint on the 3rd line -- boolean removeAll = false;
	First time breakpoint is hit is for JDIThread and DebugView is OK.  Second time is for JDIStackFrame, and
	DebugView is now entirely blank.  This seems to be source of flicker.  The entire tree should not be getting 
	removed, only the subtree rooted at the JDIThread should be getting refreshed.
	
JGS (5/31/01 12:08:33 PM)
	Sent email to NE for advice.

NE (06/01/01 12:23:25 PM)
	Also flickers if you choose Display instead of Inspect (note that Display also appends to the same line; see 1GENIVH).
	Seems to be the way the debugger is using the viewer.
	I set breakpoints in AbstractTreeViewer.internalRefresh(Object) and TreeViewer.setSelection(List).
	Here's an outline of what it's doing:

DebugContentProvider.doHandleDebugEvent(DebugEvent)
  kind=DebugEvent.SUSPEND
    DebugContentProvider(BasicContentProvider).refresh(Object)
      - refreshes thread
	- stack frame changed not equal, so preservingSelection() loses it, and selection is cleared
    DebugContentProvider.selectAndReveal(Object)
      - setS selection to THREAD
DebugContentProvider.doHandleDebugEvent(DebugEvent)
  kind=DebugEvent.SUSPEND
    DebugContentProvider(BasicContentProvider).refresh(Object)
      - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same thread, so selection is not lost
DebugContentProvider.doHandleDebugEvent(DebugEvent)
  kind=DebugEvent.SUSPEND
    DebugContentProvider(BasicContentProvider).refresh(Object)
      - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same thread, so selection is not lost
Runnable>.run() in findDebugPresentation(Object, String, String, boolean)
  DebugView.autoExpand(Object)
    - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same thread, so selection is not lost
    - sets selection to FRAME org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIStackFrame@7ee6
Runnable>.run() in findDebugPresentation(Object, String, String, boolean)
  DebugView.autoExpand(Object)
    - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same frame, so selection is not lost
DebugContentProvider.doHandleDebugEvent(DebugEvent)
  kind=DebugEvent.SUSPEND
    DebugContentProvider(BasicContentProvider).refresh(Object)
      - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same frame, so selection is not lost
Runnable>.run() in findDebugPresentation(Object, String, String, boolean)
  DebugView.autoExpand(Object)
    - refreshes thread org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JDIThread@23d9
	- same frame, so selection is not lost

Strange that it's getting multiple SUSPENDs, and refreshing each time.
I noticed that DebugContentProvider.doHandleDebugEvent() has code in the case for RESUME to return
if it thinks the thread is suspended.

In the sequence above, on the first refresh, the selection is lost because the selected stack frame
has been replaced by a different JDIFrame instance (for main), which does not compare equal 
(even though they both represent the same frame), so the viewer cannot preserve it across the refresh.
But DebugContentProvider and DebugView.autoExpand cause several refreshes, and cause the selection
to be changed to the thread, then back to the (new) frame.
The flicker is caused by the combination of the first refresh losing the selection, and the DebugContentProvider
changing the selection to the thread, then back to the frame.
The viewer can't do anything about the first case, since it has no way of knowing that the frames are the same,
since they are not equal.
The flicker may not be noticeable if DebugContentProvider could be changed to simply refresh (ideally just once), 
then select the new frame, without  selecting the thread in between.

Note that the multiple refreshes, although inefficient, are not themselves the cause of the flicker
(aside from the first one losing the selection), since the TreeViewer is ""smart"" about reusing items
and not changing labels unless necessary.

Although not indicated above, it was also refreshing the variables and inspect viewers multiple times.

PR moved back to DUI.

DW (6/1/01 12:32:09 PM)
	I think the multiple suspends are due to the fact that we do not process the resume if 
	the thread is already suspended.

filesystem since the last refresh.  Delete anyway?""  If the user clicks yes, 
then call delete a second time with force=true.  This will force deletion 
regardless of whether the filesystem is out of sync with the workbench.  I 
wouldn't recommend forcing deletion without user interaction, because files may 
have been added in the filesystem that the user forgot about.  Silently forcing

In VAJ and VAME, selecting a compilation unit opens an editor.
For the user, this is just one click, or they can use arrow keys.

Currently in Eclipse the user has to double-click to open an editor.
I would really like a preference to enable the following behavior:
	- single-click (or 'selection') opens a temporary editor
		(which can be 'pinned' afterwards if desired)
	- double-click opens an 'already-pinned' editor

I think this behavior should occur when a compilation unit or any part of it
is selected (i.e. class in hierarchy, method, package & var decls, etc).
The behavior would ideally be consistent across all views, i.e. including
search, debugger, etc. as well as all java views, including compare.
So for example if the user expanded a tree in the packages view to see
a list of methods and then selected a method, the CU editor would open;
or if the user clicks once on a method in search, an editor opens, etc.

I understand that there will be times when an editor can take a while to open.
I am willing to put up with this because most of the time I will be opening
java files, and they come up fairly quickly."

Yes, I personally create new projects rather on hourly bases. Our SCM process mandates making changes on CVS branches only and we must use a specific build system (this is C/C++ projects). The build system requires a very specific directory structure which needs to be appended to the project name every time a new project is created. When you uncheck ""Use default location"" in a New Project Wizard, the location field is cleared and one has to navigate back to the workspace using ""Browse"" button.

Fixing this particular problem is not hard, but it is hard to decide which of the many bugs in our backlog is worth our time, which is very limited unfortunately.

Thanks for asking. It was my intention before I looked at the code (and found this bug report). But I am not sure now if it is possible to do using the wizards. My streamlined process would be:

1. In CVS repository view, Check Out using New Project Wizard
2. Choose appropriate branch and Finish to proceed to C++ Wizard.
3. In C++ Wizard:
 a) enter project name matching the branch name
     and 
 b) append my specific sub-path to the default project location
4. Choose specific C++ project type (implemented by our own plugin)
5. Finish

I have difficulties with two items 3a and 3b.
 a) How to get the branch name out of CVS Wizard to use as a project name by default; and 
 b) how to change the project location in New Project Wizard programmatically and ensure CVS Wizard is aware of that. It seems that location field is a part of the platform control in the Wizard and I could not find any API to be able to set it to desirable value.

If you can offer any insight how you would approach to writing the plug-in it would be greatly appreciated.

	ImageDescriptor.createImage() is spec'ed to always return a new image, 
	so it can't return null, and can't return a shared image (i.e. the missing image).
	And it can't be changed to catch the out-of-handles SWTError and create a new missing image, 
	since it's out of handles.

	Only alternative is to change all cases to use ImageDescriptor.createImage(boolean), 
	and handle the null case and SWTError.
	
	SWTError states: SWTErrors should not occur in typical programs, although ""high reliability"" applications 
	should still catch them.
	Could change ImageDescriptor.createImage(boolean) to catch the SWTError for the out-of-handles condition
	(SWTError has a code), and have it return null.  So this would avoid the need for all users to catch it.

	Of course, it would be better not to run out of handles in the first place, but we can't control this in general.
	We can only minimize the number of images we create.


KH (8/1/2001 8:37:17 AM)
	Your proposal makes sense. Hold off making these changes until the SWT team fixes their part of this 
	problem. They are going to be releasing changes that significantly reduce the number of images that need
	to be created. 

NE (8/8/2001 3:19:49 PM)
	Try changing ActionContributionItem to not create extra images on Win98: disabled and hot image.
	Use the hot image as the regular one."

Thank you Mazen. You are correct in your diagnosis. 

This is a know bug #2046

I am curious to know why you want to use a default DialogSettings file and how 
you created it.
Since we have not published a spec for this file we are wondering if the 
correct ""fix"" is to fix the code or change the spec for 
loadDialogSettings().

You can ofcourse override this method in you own plugin.
Here is some source that does what the comment claims

protected void loadDialogSettings() {
 dialogSettings = new DialogSettings(""Workbench"");//$NON-NLS-1$

 // try r/w state area in the local file system
 String readWritePath = getStateLocation().append(FN_DIALOG_SETTINGS).toOSString
();

  try {
   dialogSettings.load(readWritePath);
  } catch (IOException e) {
   dialogSettings = new DialogSettings(""Workbench"");  // load failed so ensure 
we have an empty settings//$NON-NLS-1$
  }
 } else {   
  // not found - use installed  defaults if available

Randy,
the specs are great :-) so please don't change them....
The only missing piece is the DTD for the dialog_settings.xml  file.

What I did is I ran my Wizard once, this generates the dialog_settings.xml
in the r/w directory
of my plugin.
I then shutdown, copied the generated dialog_settings.xml file to my
plugin's install directory,
edited the values, deleted the initial dialog_settings.xml in the r/w
directory and relaunched
Eclipse, hopping to see my Wizard populated.

I want to be able to ship default Wizard settings (similar to Preference
Store hardcoded defaults
values versus Preferences.ini).
It's not must, I can hard code defaults, but it is nice to have.

regards,
Mazen...

I have added printlns to time part creation, page creation, plugin startup as 
well as used optimize-it to try find the reason for implemention any of these 
options. I concluded that I would have the proposal to be voted and I would be 
the first to vote ""-1"".

I am convinced that ""Defering Part Creation"" should not be implemented. Giving 
the user a better startup time and make him pay the price latter is not a 
solution. 
 Option 1 would be easy for us to implement but would be a problem for ISV 
developers.
 Option 2 would introduce problems in the APIs like findView and getViews. The 
time spend writing/implementing propasals on how to do this breaking change 
could be better used in something else. IMO.
 Option 3 the current implementation is not creating the controls anyway. So 
the gained time is not that much. (I have timed it).

 The big reason not to do it is stated in DS's last 3 lines.

Thanks.
Eduardo.

Hi Kevin,

While you were away Eduardo investigated the idea of deferral of part 
creation.  Then he talked with me, and we formed the following opinions.  It 
would be incorrect to defer control creation.  It would be of little value to 
defer part or page creation.

Options:

1. Defer control creation in non visible parts.  If this approach is taken, 
each part must perform a null pointer check in every public method.  If any 
method is called, and the control is null, the part must implement some hack to 
answer the method correctly.  We only see this problem for 
IWorkbenchPart.dispose, because we are the workbench.  However, this is not a 
local problem.  The view can be accessed at any time, just by calling 
IWorkbenchPage.findView.  If the view has any other public methods, they must 
also be protected.  This is not part of the view contract, and it would be a 
breaking change to impose it now.  

2. Defer part creation in non visible parts.  If this approach is taken, the 
page must consider ""part init state"" in every public method.  It is not 
appropriate to misrepresent the parts within the page, just because we wish to 
defer their creation.   For instance, if findView is called for a part which 
hasn't been created, we must create the part and return its handle.  If 
getViews is called, we must also create all of the parts and return their 
handles; the result of this method should not be dependent on the init state of 
the page.  The getViews method in particular will be called as soon as the page 
is visible, because we use it to populate the Perspective > Show View menu.  We 
can implement this algorithm, but it will have no performance impact.  

3. Defer creation of everything within a non visible page.  If this approach is 
taken, we might be able to defer part creation, assuming that none of the part 
centric methods of the page area called.  However, if the loss of context 
proposal is approved, we will discourage the use of multipage mode, and this 
change will have no impact.

Regardless of whether 1, 2, or 3 is taken, the results of the optimization will 
be very dependent upon layout.  We cannot predictably determine the improvement 
in start up time.  

We also have one big issue with the idea of lazy creation.  By introducing lazy 
creation, we will also introduce staggered delays.  For instance, it may take 5 
seconds to switch to an invisible view in a tab folder.  It may take 10 seconds 
to activate a page.  From a user perspective, we are not convinced that this is 
an acceptable behavior.  It would be better to accept the startup cost at 
startup time.

The more toolbar buttons there are, the shorter the highlighting is.

This looks funny, giving the titlebar an unpleasant, bruise-like mix of blue and grey,
and is inconsistent with the highlighting in the window titlebar (on Windows).

It can also lead to visual inconsistency within the workbench itself.
If I have two views, one above the other, or stacked together, where one has more toolbar buttons than the other,
then the highlighting has a different width between the two views.  This is noticeable when switching between them.
E.g. try switching between the Properties and Outline views.

Steps to reproduce:
1) create a file in your OS without an extension 'test'
2) in Eclipse do an import on file system
3) in the directory field, find the parent directory of 'test'
4) click 'Select All'
5) click 'Select Types' and type '*.' in the 'Other Extensions' text field, click OK

	Clearing on startup basically defeats the purpose of the mechanism.
	This information is, by default, kept with the workspace.  For whatever reason it was
	decided that we would not expose a notion of login or user etc so the previously entered
	passwords are automatically available.  The only options to address this real issue are:
		1) make users real

"
2066,erich_gamma@ch.ibm.com,2002-12-16T17:14:04Z,12,0,">Q: should it show on any kind of problem 
I'd prefer to show the task view on any kind of problem. Otherwise the user 
might miss a warning. The model would be that whenever there is ""builder"" 
output in the form of a marker the task list is shown. I'd expect that builders 
will give the user control over the warnings that should be generated (see JDT 
for an example). 

>Q: should it select the (earliest) new problem?
I'd opt for revealing the first new problem only. When considering the task 
list like an output log I wouldn't expect that new output is selected.

Additional question:
Q: What is done if there is a filter that hides the problem? Will the task list 
still be brought to front? Could the icon of the task view indicate that there 
is new content. Once the task view receives focus the icon would switch back to 
the standard one."

- When the view is stacked behind other views, it is brought to the front with 
no focus
- When it is a fast view, it is popped out *and* given focus
- When is doesn't exist at all, it is created and not given focus

Is this the desired behaviour for showing the task view?"

development but rather deployment or other activities, and having the Tasks

you're doing these other activities, you're probably not doing builds.
Erich or Darin, have you received any complaints to this effect with the

an issue, we can address it for both.

there were indeed complaints, in particular when the console was brought to 
front for any output (a web server can provide lots of output). It was 
addressed by a preference ""show on error/show on output"".

It looks like auto revealing is highly sensitive due to the loss of context and 
some users simply might not want it.

The initial setting should be to reveal the task view since the motivation for 
this effort was that first time users find the task view.  "

do a save (to clear some fixed errors), my task list leaps up again, when I just

This is compounded by the pref to turn this off being very hard to find. I

easier to stop."

I've seen task lists containing tens of thousands of entries because of simple mistakes.
The problem?
Well, what am I going to do with 100,000 entries anyway?
The list takes about 30seconds to load and if you have filters on, then
it takes about the same amount of time to update as you select different
files in the properties view.  Since this operation occurs automatically
for you, and cannot be aborted... it's a bit of a pain -- and it could take you
15 minutes just to fix a one-character mistake in a library path or something. =(

To reproduce:
	1) Take a perfectly functional project.
	2) Delete the library paths (kill .classpath)
	3) Build.
	4) Wait.
	5) Look at your task list...
	6) Select some other file in the project.

	moving to JCORE for comment

CM (5/28/2001 12:13:28 PM)
	This is actually quite important. We need this ""feature"" or something like it.
	Our problem on the SWT team is that when we load the swt project from the repository,
	it does not initially have a .classpath file. (because our .classpath is platform-specific,
	so we create our .classpath file after loading). After a build, there are 20,000 errors or so.
	On Windows, the ""only"" problem is that it takes forever to populate the Table widget.
	On Linux, we crash. The Table widget can't handle the volume.
	You can imagine that if autobuild is on and someone innocently loads the swt project
	on Linux (this has happened more than once) they will crash.

	Changing the platform of this PR from WIN2000 to ALL, and removing the DCR from the title.

PM (5/29/2001 3:05:49 PM)
	Why don't you simply hit the Cancel button ? I understand that an auto-cancel action would be nice, but this could be handled by the platform.

JB (30/05/2001 11:51:58 AM)
	Cancel is insufficient as you don't always get enough realtime feedback from the
	compiler to know when to cancel.  Moreover, without an auto-cancel option or a
	high-water limit on the number of permissible tasks in the Task view, loading, refreshing
	and filtering the Task view can become a significant burden on the system in terms of CPU
	time and memory resources.  Hence cancelling manually midway through a build could still
	leave 10000 errors behind (it does not take long for them to accumulate) and may cause
	deteriorated application (and in the extreme case, system-wide) performance.

	Nonetheless, I believe the issue can wait until the next release as it does not
	occur frequently in normal operation.  It may be a source of concern for those people
	migrating existing code to our product as things can sometimes be quite ""broken"" in the
	first stages of any migration until all the compiler options and build paths get
	set right.

CM (6/4/2001 2:32:53 PM)
	FYI, I just timed a compile that had 30,434 problems.
	This was extremely easy to do, because if I load all of SWT and its examples and internal examples
	at one time with ""autobuild"" on, and then go away for a coffee, this is exactly what will happen.
	(because SWT intentionally does not have a .classpath file).

	It takes under 2 minutes to compile all of that stuff, but populating the Tasks view's Table
	(which is a native Table widget, therefore we cannot fix it) takes over 6 minutes.

PM (6/18/2001 5:24:24 PM)
	The feedback problem from the compiler is a JDTCORE bug, which we already have a PR for.
	Now the 6 minutes update is a UI issue. Moving to UI land for archiving.

Same thing about CVS history. If you have a long description, you will never be 
able to see it. Tooltip does not seems to support EOL as well since the dreaded 
black square is displayed.

I'm not sure about the strategy to use here. We cannot rely on the data to have 
a reasonable line length so there might be a need to justify the text to a max-
tooltip width and have a max tooltip height as well and being able to scroll 
the tooltip. That might be needed for Javadoc as well, right now long javadoc 
is purely and simply cut.

Also the filter action should be ""selected filter items should be NOT be 
shown"", versus ""shown"", with the default being to filter out expert. That makes 
the most sense and is consistent with most of the other filter functions in 
other viewers.

Plus the filter setting should be stored in the preferences for the 
propertysheet plugin (or somewhere like the other viewers) so that they will be 
persisted. It is annoying to select a set of preferences, and then have to do 
this each and every time I come up.

But for short term, the bug itself is that the filter list does opposite of 
what it is supposed to do, as noted in the original text of this bug. It should 
be default of Filter out expert, not show all. The logic currently will either 
show all or show all but expert. When expert is not filtered, you still want to 
see all non-expert plus the expert, otherwise you want to see all except 
expert. You don't want the case where it shows ONLY expert.

Date: Wed, 31 Oct 2001 15:06:38 -0500

When working with several editors all on the "".classpath"" file, it is a
nightmare trying to tell which one is which.
Something needs to be done to clarify which one is which.  Perhaps a
workspace-relative path on each.
Separately, the active Editors full title should appear on the SWT shell

sense to open the Bookmarks View if it is not already open (without giving it focus).
This would be especially useful when in the Java Perspective as the Bookmarks View is
not one of default views, but this also applies to bookmarking in any Perspective.

1) create a new Java Project
2) add a new class to the project
3) open the class in the editor (double click)
4) right click in the margin of the editor and select ""Add Bookmark""
5) give the bookmark a name

Here you see the bar icon appear in the margin to indicate the bookmark.
To reference your bookmark however, you need to do the following:

menu: Perspective->Show View->Other...[Expand 'Basic'->Bookmarks]

If the auto-open Bookmarks is implemented, it is important not to give it focus,
we don't want to interrupt the user when he adds a bookmark.  By opening the view
a new user will know how to reference her bookmarks.

2) in the Navigator, add a file in the root directory
3) create a new directory
4) make the file read-only (right click on file, click properties, Info, click ""Read Only"", click OK)
5) drag and drop the file to another directory

The file is moved without prompting the user.  The workbench should ALWAYS verify that the user
really wants to move the read-only file.

TM (6/7/2001 14:17:49)
	While the crash might very well be a Netscape bug. We should handle the crashed editor better.

KM (6/7/01 12:40:24 PM)
	Moving to UI for consideration on exception in MenuManager.

DS (6/7/01 6:06:42 PM)
	From the stack trace it looks like we are trying to update a pulldown within
	the window menu.

	NegativeArraySizeException =  Thrown if an application tries to create 
	an array with negative size.

	I am confused.  Within MenuManager we don't allocate any arrays.  The only
	allocation is a ""new ArrayList"" (see below).  If some inline optimization is performed 
	the error may occur in the ArrayList constructor where a real array is allocated.  But that 
	implies that ""items.length"" < 0.  According to the java spec ""length may be positive 
	or zero"".

		protected void update(boolean force, boolean recursive) {
			if (isDirty() || force) {
				if (menu != null && !menu.isDisposed()) {
					// clean contains all active items without double separators
					IContributionItem[] items= getItems();
					List clean= new ArrayList(items.length);

	We also call menu.getItems further down in the method.  The getItems method will
	query the system to determine the item count for the menu.  If an error occurs in
	OS.GetMenuItemCount the result is -1.  Then menu.getItems tries to
	allocate an array of size -1.  This probably causes the exception.

	The netscape editor opens  in an OleEditor, so it will replace some pulldown menus
	within the window menubar.   It is not clear how MenuManager.update will cooperate if
	we do an update.  

	Hypothesis # 1: The menubar contains a combination of our own menus and those 
	contributed by netscape.  MenuManager.update removes all which are unknown.  And 
	our own pulldown menus which have a menu manager ( probably the case above ) may 
	not be ""realized"".  Either type of pulldown menu may return -1 if OS.GetMenuItemCount
	is called.

	Hypothesis # 2: Kevin says there is complete separation between the ole menu and
	our own.  In my own testing I find that we can normally query the items in our menubar
	even when another menu is active.  The error situation above may just be a
	side effect of the netscape error.

	Have asked Veronika to comment.

VI (6/8/2001 10:02:50 AM)
	OLE creates its own menubar which it super imposes on the applications menubar.
	The ole menu bar is completely separate from the applications menubar.
	The only entries in the ole menu bar that come  from the application are those provided
	in OleFrame.setFileMenus, OleFrame.setWindowMenus and OleFrame.setContainerMenus.

	Is some cleanup being done on the MenuItem objects passed in to these methods?

DS (6/8/01 11:37:01 AM)
	We may modify the contents of these menus while the ole editor is active.  For
	instance, we may add items to File New or the Perspective menu.

DS (6/8/01 12:44:25 PM)
	I talked with VI about this.  It should be OK to modify the contents of our menus while
	an OLE editor is active.  And in my own testing I am able to modify the actions which
	appear in the menu ( via action sets ) with no problems.

	Getting back to the original problem, ie the workbench died without putting up a dialog,
	our menu bar is corrupted.  There is nothing we can do.  At least we log the
	problem.  We can do a readme for this scenario.

Is this as it should be?  I think this behaviour is actually preferable to giving an error dialog.
But maybe it should warn that the parent folder has been deleted, and offer to recreate it,
giving the user the chance to cancel it.
Otherwise, it feels like the environment has discovered that it was out of synch, but hasn't bothered
to tell the user.  If there were other resources in the parent, they would still be showing in the navigator,
but would not exist in the filesystem.  If it prompts, it could do a refresh local too if the user accepts recreating the parent.

	usability feedback from GDA
Progress dialog on saving is very distracting/annoying 
it also causes the entire workbench to flash because the progress 
dialog causes the workbench to lose/gain focus. important

NOTES:"
2229,eclipse@genady.org,2001-11-17T12:54:16Z,1,0,"Sometimes the save operation takes a long time, and I want to
watch the progress. 
It should be displayed only if the predicted save time is longer than a second

An alternative would be to show the progress in status bar so that it is less
distracting."
2229,aleb@delsyne.ro,2002-03-29T22:59:28Z,3,0,"You could measure the time taken by the save operation and store it.. At the next save operation, if the stored time is > 2s you show the progress dialogue.. and store the new time."

This one is important to us, since it is on the critical path for incrementally 
compiling a method. 
Not showing this dialog would significantly improve the perceived performance 
of small incremental builds."
2229,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2002-05-26T19:10:18Z,5,0,"We've encountered some stumbling blocks in being able to do this.
Things are complicated by the fact that Save is done in the UI thread.

Reducing priority since this is not a stop-ship.
"
2229,erich_gamma@ch.ibm.com,2002-05-26T19:54:34Z,6,0,"Then could save use at least the progress bar in the status line provided by 
ApplicationWindow? This would also reduce the flicker. 

BTW, this progress bar should use an Eclipse style stop icon (the one that is 
currently shown was manually crafted during the LeapFrog age)."
2229,erich_gamma@ch.ibm.com,2002-05-26T20:22:43Z,7,0,"If the problem is that Save is run in the UI thread than another solution is to 
check the elapsed time on each progress tick and to only show the progress 
dialog after some elapsed time. To handle the case of a long no progress tick 
interval an SWT timer could be used."
2229,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2002-05-27T14:12:04Z,8,0,"We're looking further at ApplicationWindow.run.
It has the following problems:
- it disables the window (everything but the shell itself), so it will lose 
input
- it's flashy
- the disabling does not currently cover the shortcut bar, since this is not 
known to ApplicationWindow

However, 
  - ProgressMonitorDialog blocks input anyway, so this is not a major loss
  - ProgressMonitorDialog is more flashy
  - we can fix the shortcut bar problem

Also, note that we cannot use an SWT timer if we're running in the UI thread, 
since it requires the event loop to be running.
"
2229,Adam_Schlegel@oti.com,2002-05-27T17:40:50Z,9,0,"ApplicationWindow.run uses get/setEnabled methods on the various components of 
the window to disable them during the operation. However, these methods lose 
the current keyboard focus. There does not appear to be the necessary API to 
save/restore the focus state.

If the user is making changes in the current editor, and then saves via Ctrl+s, 
it is inappropriate to take keyboard focus away from the curent editor. This 
amounts to an even worse usability problem than presently exists."

Implementation Issues"

I also changed the icon to a better one we had lying around (will double-check 
with Linda).

Erich, could you please try it out.  You will need to load our changes from 
HEAD.

There are some known layout problems which we want to fix up.
The progress bar and cancel button appear on the right, after the Java editors' 
status line contributions for Writable, Insert, and cursor position.
They should appear to the left of them, taking up the right side of the message 
area without moving the other contributions.
"
2229,erich_gamma@ch.ibm.com,2002-05-30T10:14:26Z,13,0,"Tried it - incremental builds feel now much faster. This is great progress!

Issues:
- other top-level shells are not disabled only the application window. If a 
build takes longer you can start a second build from another workbench window 
and you will deadlock. In LeapFrog we had code that disabled all Shells to 
handle this case. Dirk wrote the code and he is trying to find it again. This 
approach has worked well in LeapFrog.

- since incremental builds are fast the appearance looks like flicker. Showing 
the progress after some elapsed time (2 seconds) would help. The check-the-
elapsed-time-on-a-progress-tick should work. To handle the case of no tick for 
an extended period you could use a timer thread.

If the disabling problem is fixed then we would like to use the progress in the 
status line for other actions as well (e.g. opening a type hierarchy, opening 
the all types dialog). Is there any reason to not doing so?"

We will also see what we can do about flicker.

As for using it in other places, I'm concerned about different operations using 
different progress monitors.  I think it would be confusing if the user could 
not predict where a given operation would report progress.
If it's just save, it's predictable.
But, if you think using it in other places makes sense for JDT, go ahead.

	Up changes the input to be the parent of the current input (independent of the selection), 
	adding to the history rather than going back in the history.
	Back, Forward and Up work similarly to Explorer.

	There's no icon for Go Into, because I felt that toolbar icons should apply to the whole view, independent of the selection.
	Go Into and Go To are separate entries because I didn't want the user to have to select Go To, then Into.

I second this. 

(essential)  An easy hot-key (e.g. NOT something so acrobatic as ctrl-F6) to 
toggle between editors in most-recently-used order (such as Windoes ALT-TAB).

(nice) A way to ""tear off"" editor windows like is possible with other windows.  
Personally, I loved VAJ's class-browser with its own window, and it's own 
Taskbar (on win32) icon.  That's how I did _all_ my editing.
"
2261,eduardo_pereira@ca.ibm.com,2001-11-29T20:40:32Z,2,0,"This is a problem that we are working on now. 

Ctrl F6 was changed to switch editors as the Windows Alt+TAB and Ctrl F7 was 
added to switch views.
A dialog was added to enable the user to manage all editors (Menu>Window>Switch 
Editor). From this dialog you can close, save, view recent closed editors and 
switch to any editor in any perspective. 
The concept of re-using editors as also added to the workbench. The 
preference ""Number of open editors before reusing"" is in the workbench 
preference page and once ""N"" editors are opened the oldest editor (in the 
activation order) is reused. A ""Pin"" button was added to the toolbar so the 
user can ""PIN"" a editor which will not be reused while pinned.

This work is still in development but is already released in the 2.0 stream.
Any feedback is appreciated. We think editor management is important and is 
difficult problem to solve and we would like to see any new idea from users.

I was a VAJ user as well and used/loved the ""VAJ's class-browser"". I think you 
can get the same behavior by changing the preferences ""Workbench->Open a new 
perspective in a new Window"" and ""Java->Open new type hierarchy inside the

Another idea according to the problem with the limited tab-area vs. many open

How about extending the tab area to multiline instead of a scrollable tab area?
As used for example in Textpad (if according setting is activated).

When exporting to a JAR, the user must enter the extension manually.

Steps:
1) Make sure you have a project in your workspace
2) menu: File->Export...
3) select JAR file, click Next
4) select some resources to export
5) where it says ""Where do you want to export resources to?"" click
browse...
6) you will get a save dialog, ensure *.jar is selected for ""Save as type""
7) enter a file name ""myProject"" (without including an extension), click Save

The expected behavior is to save the JAR as 'myProject.jar', instead it is saved
without an extension.

If you goto export again, you will notice the combo box remembers your previous
save, but it added the .jar for you this time.

To see the expected behavior, run Microsoft Word; goto Save As... and enter a file
without the extension, the file will save with the .doc extention.

NOTES:
JEL (30/05/2001 4:50:05 PM)
	When the user clicks Finish, if the file string does not end with "".jar"" it should be
appended.  If the user wishes to save without the extension (s)he should be allowed to
edit the text field within the wizard."

I have noticed while using the version label annotations that getLabel() is called with 
very high frequency in the navigator.  It seems like it might be doing excessive work.  
The VCM label decoration isn't too expensive, but when invoked frequently, it may contribute 
to general loss of responsiveness in the UI.  
For example, just changing the selection in the navigator asks for the labels again.  
Also, during notification phases, getLabel is called frequently.

NOTES:

Thanks, I'll take a look.  It shouldn't be doing this just when the selection changes, 
unless one of the selection listeners on the viewer is interested.
Actually, it might be the forward/back/up buttons updating their tooltips.  But I'll investigate."

I encountered a NPE during a build after which my workbench PAFed (possibly due to
the SWT exception which I received at the same time).

I had loaded the debug teams projects from our repository.  They do not use
variables yet, so I was setting up the project to use variables so that I could
test cross platform development selfhosting.

I brought up the project properties dialog on the Eclipse Launcher plugin which only
contains Main & UIMain.  I changed the build path to include two variables, the JRE_LIB
and one I created PLUGINS/org.eclipse.core.runtime/runtime.jar.  I then hit ok and the
workbench started a build (autobuild on).  After a while the Progress dialog said ""Running.""
and was completely filled, then the workbench PAFed and I got the following in the error log.

	and at the end of the snapshot notification is being broadcast.  In the notification someone is trying
	to dispose a widget that is already disposed.
	Moving to UI

SA (6/1/2001 3:49:23 PM)
	Not having any luck reproducing this problem. Sent e-mail to Jed to get more information. Very
	weird error for sure. If you look at ViewPane::updateTitles, it made calls to the CLabel before
	calling setToolTipText() (for example, it called getText() in the if statement). None of those
	failed so the widget was not disposed. Somehow, someone disposed the widget prior to
	the setToolTipText() call!"

	This could not be reproduce. I can resize the same fast view multiple times.
	I tried this with build 0.115 plus loaded the lastest Eclipse UI changes (0.117).

KK (2001-06-01 15:03:38)
	In driver 0.116 for Linux (out of the box), the problem still exists.
	Sometimes resize works 1 to 4 times, and then breaks.
	Drag any view to make it a fast view, show it.  Position a mouse over
	the right edge of the fast view.  The cursor changes to horizontal resize.
	Drag the edge of the view left or right. Repeat the resize.
	Eventually cursor will stop changing to resize cursor and resize is impossible.
	Pinning the view and making it fast view again does not help (still cannot resize
	that view).
	I have found that if I move the mouse very slowly, I get ""more moves"".
	If I drag the mouse fast and release the edge, it is more likely to break then.

	May be increasing mouse acceleration in preferences of your test machine can help
	recreate the problem.

in sync.  You will get an error ""Zip file must have at least one entry"" which is not the case.
If you do a refresh from local, the export will work.

Quick fix: Have a more generic error message ""Error(s) exporting.""

Ideal fix:
1) Do a refresh from local for all projects automatically when the user selects 'Export...'
-or-
2) Do a refresh from local for a single project when the user selects, expands, or checks the
project node.

Refresh from local is executed very fast when there are no files out of sync with the system
so I don't think the cost of doing this each time you export is that drastic.
It wouldn't hurt to pop up the Refreshing dialog to indicate to the user why the CPU is chugging

Before entering the export wizard, the user should be prompted to save their work.  There is a good
chance the user is planning to export the file they are currently editing and could easily forget to save.
If they are exporting, the user rarely checks the contents of the jar/zip so the exported work may not
be what they desire.

1) open a .java file in a project
2) make some changes to the file, don't save
3) File->export (file system)

Bug 1 Note the tab has the icon for the property sheet editor not the Default text editor
(it is the default editor because it has no outline)

Now close the editor and double click the file, it opens with the defualt text editor again.

When did I ask to change the default (double click) editor to the ""Default system editor""?
All I did was an open with.

This is probably working a designed because there is a check beside the default system editor (indicating
that it is the default?)

But I find the design is confusing.

Changing the default editor for a file type should not be a side effect of performing an Open With

match(...) should match the whole string.  find(...) can find any occurrence.
A pattern of """" should only match the empty string.
For example: new StringMatcher(""ab"", false, false).match(""abz"") is false,
so new StringMatcher("""", false, false).match(""z"") should be false too, but it's currently true.

This is due to the segCount == 0 test, which should check whether there are actually wildcards before returning true.
The next two tests check for empty target and empty pattern, but they're not currently reached.

I also noticed another bug, where if ignoreWildcards is true, it doesn't check the length.
So new StringMatcher(""a"", false, true).match(""ab"") currently returns true, but it should return false.

The corrected lines are:
		if (fIgnoreWildCards)
			return (end - start == fLength) && fPattern.regionMatches(fIgnoreCase, 0, text, start, fLength);
		int segCount = fSegments.length;
		if (segCount == 0 && (fHasLeadingStar || fHasTrailingStar))  // pattern contains only '*'(s)

I think closing the current editor would be surprising behaviour.  Prompting is 
an option, but even with the prompt, editors still need to be prepared to deal 
with out-of-sync problems.

The text editors have an underlying document model, which could be used to keep 
multiple editors in sync.  But they would have to all participate in the 
document model.

Kai, is this reasonable?  If I open a text editor and a CU editor on the same 
file, do they share the same document?  I assume so since they share the same 
FileDocumentProvider.

If this is the case, allowing multiple open editors on the same file may not be 
as bad for out-of-sync problems as we may think."

I think we should just encourage editors to support a shared document model

"

the editor input.  Note that this means it does not open a new editor if there's
already one open with the same id and input.
So:
- open java editor on A.java
- open plain text editor on A.java

TC (6/5/01 8:44:01 AM) - the dirty bit is not shown on OLE Editors because there is no

SA (6/5/2001 9:45:47 AM)
	For ActiveX Contols, you can make use of one of the IPersistStorage interfaces
	and call isDirty() on it. I'm pretty sure you can do the same for an embedded ole
	object too. There is also the IAdviseSink2 interface that can be hooked up via
	the IOleObject interface. There is also some support via the IDataObject (but if
	my memory serves me correctly, this was not always exposed. Anyway, its been
	3 years since I've worked in this stuff...maybe my mind is failing me ;-)

VI (6/5/2001 11:51:53 AM)

I am using the IPersistStorage mechanism as shown below.  I can investigate the IAdviseSink2 mechanism.

public boolean isDirty() {
	// Get access to the persistant storage mechanism
	int[] address = new int[1];
	if (objIOleObject.QueryInterface(COM.IIDIPersistFile, address) != COM.S_OK)
		return false;
	IPersistStorage permStorage = new IPersistStorage(address[0]);
	// Are the contents of the permanent storage different from the file?
	int result = permStorage.IsDirty();
	permStorage.Release();
	return (result == COM.S_OK);
}

KH (6/6/2001 8:12:10 AM)
	Pls followup with VI. There is API that we are NOT calling. 

EJP (6/6/01 2:37:48 PM)
	- We are not calling filePropertyChange when we save the text.
	- We are not calling the SWT API isDirty() because there is not API to
	add a listener to get a callback when the editor becames dirty so we
	can't enable and disable menus.
	- The menu acelerators are not working (Ctrl S, Ctrl F4 etc).  (PS: The OLE
			editor menu acelerators work.)
	- MSWord gets dirty every time it is activated.
	- The SWT API isDirty() works for MSWord and MSPaint but does not work with PPT.

EJP (6/6/01 4:04:34 PM)
	About the original problem discribed in this PR.
	The text is not being save because the editor being open is Wordpad not WinWord.
	The fix for it is to change the method OleEditor>>#usesStorageFiles()
	to use ""Word.Document"" instead of ""Word"" which is more WinWord specific.

2369,darryl@netbauds.net,2006-05-12T04:01:26Z,19,0,"This feature gets my vote.  But I have throughts more over on where this would be leading.

I regularly have Eclipse open permanently on my virtual desktop under Linux/KDE.  The only reason I restart it is when it crashes or locks up.  Currently I am happy with the reliability as my Eclipse will crash maybe once a week, however as you can imagine the state that gets opened is what I was working on the last time I cleanly shutdown (at least a week old).

To make things really cool it would be nice if there is a clean/dirty exit flag in the state info.  So eclipse can detect if it crashed, by marking it as dirty while Eclipse is started and only the File -> Exit function during shutdown marks it clean.

Then maybe as a feature on from this there was an automatic mode which detected it crashed before (when you next start it) and it offers to:

* Restore all state info

* Restore all state info (except editor views)

* Restore default state, ignores all state info and will clobber it next time state info is saved, at next exit/explict save (maybe this is not needed, or maybe this is like -clean, but the purpose of this function is a get out of jail option for the possibility of a corrupted state file from causing other bugs to get triggered that make Eclipse die during startup.  Maybe that clean/dirty flag should be tri-state to also record if Eclipse was still booting up at the time it last crashed out.


Then my next feature request would be automatic periodic intelligent background state storing, at least automatic updating of current open editors list.  As Comment #9 points out there is some form of value in platform perferences, which I have set to 5 mins, but it doesn't work as I would expect.

The current situation is a PITA at worst.

Saving the workspace is pretty painless (most of you already do it every 5 minutes by default - see the Workspace preference page) but saving the workbench requires us shutting down and restarting the workbench windows so that any state plug-ins save on shutdown is saved (like when you change the positioning of the editor tabs).

The question for is it better to save more by restarting the workbench or to be less ""in your face"" but quietly saving the workspace in the background?

Personally I find the latter more interesting but you are the ones voting so please let me know your preference here before I proceed.

But I would like it to save a versioned Local History of a file periodically in the background.  This would mean producing an MD5/SHA1 or other checksum of the starting file (when it was first opened and each time it was saved with File -> Save action).  This provides an absolute starting point to be able to trace history back to the original file.

Then keep the latest copy of open file data in some sort of private workspace/project area.  This is what would be periodically saved as per user preference we are talking about, 5 mins, 1 min, etc...  This is a bit like Microsoft Word temp files that are created when you open any document, in that file is also the redo/undo history of the changes that were made, this is allows MS Word to do ""automatic recovery of documents after a crash"".

I would also appreciate that the list of currently opened editors also be updated through this mechanism.  This can be ontained by virtue of the files that are registered with local history via this mechanism.


When eclipse restarts or opens the file again it should check to see if a copy of that file has an entry in the Local History and offer solutions to that situation:

 * Open the file that was saved (ignore the history and throw the local history away).
 * Open the file that was saved and replace the editor contents with the more recent data from local history (this marks the file as edited but not yet saved with the ""*"" next to the file name).
 * If the copy on disc is newer and/or not the exact original copy the Local History started with then explain the findings to the user and offer to open both into 2 different editors, with the copy from local history not having any filename assigned to it but offering a default filename to Save As dialogs which would replace the original file.


I can not stress how important it is for all this stuff to happen asynchronously in the background, editing a file in eclipse and switching editors and opening a new file and saving a file already take long enough in eclipse that it can be painful at times and none of the above here needs to be done synchronously (i.e. don't hold up the GUI while doing it).

Thanks for the patch.

Comment 1:

I wouldn't pass in the E4Application.  Instead in org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt.E4Application.loadApplicationModel(IApplicationContext, IEclipseContext) when the IModelResourceHandler is instantiated you can put it in the IEclipseContext.

Your workbench method can consume it from there, since the E4Application saveModel is basically a call to IModelResourceHandler save.


Comment 2:

I would put the IModelResourceHandler in a safe runnable as well.

comment 3:

Your job should use the progress monitor to set the task name and mark when done() at a minimum.

comment 4:

While I'm not a big fan of adding preferences, I think that this is such a change that there should be one, even if we make the default 10 minutes in 4.3.  Setting it to 0 should disable this feature (if we run into trouble in the field).  I'd suggest adding it to the org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.dialogs.IDEWorkbenchPreferencePage page (and adding the workbench keyword to that preference page definition).

You could make it similar to the workspace save interval from org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.dialogs.IDEWorkspacePreferencePage

I have implemented copying but it does not fix the problem.

I am looking in the workbench.xmi file but so far I have found no evidence of multiple copies of each command even though they show up in the IDE. However, I am sure that the number of duplicates is equal to the number of times that it has autosaved and then been closed abruptly.

Steps to reproduce:
- Change the WORKBENCH_AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS constant in Workbench to something shorter like 40,000
- Launch eclipse in the debugger
- Wait for WORKBENCH_AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS multiplied by how many duplicates you want.
- Press the stop button in the parent Eclipse to stop the child abruptly, simulating a crash.

The constant 1 is the command element, for every crash a menuContribution block is added that adds another duplicate, and for every crash the menu child has all its elements duplicated.

You're doing great, Tristan.  I empathize that it's hard to track some of this stuff down.

In org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.MenuManagerRenderer.createWidget(MUIElement, Object) we add a dispose listener to the Menu widget, and call org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.MenuManagerRenderer.cleanUp(MMenu) on the matching model element when the widget is disposed.

That removes all of the org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.ContributionRecord that were generated when it was rendered.  I believe that anything that comes in through org.eclipse.ui.menus becomes a ContributionRecord when it's instantiated by way of MMenuContribution processing (all in or around MenuManagerRenderer).

Does the MenuManagerRenderer deal with toolbars as well? Right now my problem has to do with where toolbars get removed. The toolbars I am referring to are in the trim bar MTrimmedWindow->getTrimBars()->MTrimBar->getChildren().

I'm currently investigating the behaviour and how I can replicate it.

So far I have no idea what the criteria for which toolbars are removed before shutdown is but based on your tip I believe it probably is any toolbar that is created with a contribution is removed.

I also discovered that as I suspected the toolbars without toolBarContributions elements are the ones that are not removed on shutdown.

The TrimBarRenderer class currently keeps a list of which toolbars need to be removed from specific MTrimBars. The type is HashMap<MTrimBar, ArrayList<ArrayList<MTrimElement>>>, yuck.

I'm thinking of distributing the list of what needs to be cleaned up into the model as a *transient* attribute. MTrimBar would have an attribute named pendingCleanup of type List<MTrimElement> that would contain references to all the trim elements that need to be cleaned up.

This way when I copy the model it would preserve the references and I wouldn't need to access the renderer. It would also make doing the work in a background thread easier since I wouldn't need to access anything but the model copy.

Part of the problem I have right now is that the pendingCleanup hash map is based on object sameness which doesn't hold when I copy the model so I would have to use index-based similarity which would complicate the process significantly.

Hi Tristan, thank you again for the patch update.

I haven't had time to review it yet, but 2 things come to mind.

1) I noticed the pending trim cleanup, although I didn't get to deep into it.  We've been keeping information like that in the renderer instead of the model (as it doesn't seem to make sense to have it in the model, where it could be saved out).  What's the main reason to have it there?  Is it just that's a good location for it to be looked up?

2) I don't believe the main menu attribute can be labeled transient.  While we add and remove it all the time in the 4.x Workbench, proper Eclipse4 RCP apps don't, it's part of the model that they load from the xmi file.

PW"
2369,trishume@gmail.com,2013-01-07T18:26:23Z,80,0,"The reason I put the pendingCleanup in the model is so that I could access it from the Workbench object where I have to clean it up. The other reason is that when I do the copy of the model, the references in the copy point to the copied trimBars and not the original.

If I kept the pendingCleanup info in the renderer not only would I have to do a tree walk to access the renderer, I would have to use some kind of hack to compare the copied trimBars with the references to the originals, since the normal cleanup compares based on sameness.

Putting it in the model is a simple and clean and I have marked the property as transient so it is not saved.

In terms of the mainMenu I will unmark it as transient and programmatically clean it up instead.

Tristan, the problem we were trying to overcome was that if we save out the entire trim and main menu then on startup we end up with duplicates because the WorkbenchWindow recreates a lot of stuff, right?  That's why marking the main menu attribute as transient (so it wasn't saved) worked.

What if you simply delete the main menu and trim bars or their contents from your model copy before you write it out?

That would remove some of the more complicated clean up code, and the main menu and trim bars would be recreated by the WorkbenchWindow code in a recovery situation.

Does that sound reasonable from what you've seen?

PW"
2369,trishume@gmail.com,2013-01-08T18:17:59Z,84,0,"That is exactly what my code does. My new code simply removes the mainMenu from the model before writing it out.

The pitfall with the trim bars is that only *some* trim items can be removed without causing problems. The trim items that are created through contributions need to be removed but other ones can't be.

That is why I need access to the pendingCleanup list, which keeps track of which trim items are created through contributions so I know which ones to remove from the model before writing it out. I can't directly reference the contributions to determine which items should be removed without some hacky comparison based on identifier strings.

I also remove the contributions themselves from the model before writing it.

I agknowledge that there should be an off setting in case there is a bug in the auto-saving code but that doesn't mean it should be off by default.

Unless Eclipse crashes the auto-save code has no effect, on shutdown the state is still persisted normally. The auto-saving also has little performance penalty, it takes a few milliseconds every 10 minutes by default.

However, when Eclipse does crash it prevents the very annoying behaviour of losing all your workbench configuration and open files. If the default is off the majority of users won't turn it on until they encounter the problem multiple times, get annoyed and Google it.

You'll have to lock the UI while taking the snapshot in order to avoid inconsistent state being saved. This might freeze the UI for a short period, no? Also, if the snapshot interval is 10 minutes then this gives a false impression of safety (this is a different topic, not related to whether the feature is on or off by default). I would probably reduce that number if I'd decide to use the feature.

I fear that the restore code makes more damage trying to restore something, but maybe I'm wrong. So far, when my Eclipse crashed I worried about loosing open editors or some settings. The real pain is that it rebuilds my workspace which takes very long.


If the feature turns out to be non-disruptive and that restore indeed works correctly, then I'm also fine to have it enabled by default but probably with a shorter interval."
2369,trishume@gmail.com,2013-01-11T18:14:10Z,89,0,"Sounds good, thanks for clarifying.

Right now the code copies the model and then does cleanup and saving all in the UI thread, in order to minimize the time it locks I am moving the cleanup and saving to a background job.

After that I will insert some timing code and test how long it freezes the UI thread, it should be only a few milliseconds.

In terms of safety, I am diligently comparing my auto-save output to the output of proper shutdown save. Right now there is only around 5 lines of difference, all of which are invisible separator menu elements and things that have no effect on the actual workbench. I will work on ironing those out so that I can achieve 100% sameness."

Keep in mind this is also while running in a debugger, on a ~5 year old computer with tons of plugins installed (PYDev, Aptana, PDE, CDT, Vrapper, Mylyn, etc...) so it should be even faster.

So I don't think that the UI thread locking time will be a real issue, it will only take the blink of an eye:

I've rebased your pull request and I've attached it as a patch.  I'll review it tomorrow, as we have to open any CQs for Kepler this week.

Thanks again Tristan.

Hi Tristan, this looks pretty good.  I've added some comments to be addressed directly in the pull request.

Would you be able to address them soon? I have to open a CQ by Friday to get this included in Kepler.  The other option if you don't have time is I open the CQ and commit this patch, and we address the other (admittedly minor) issues as smaller contributions.

I'll try and make your suggested changes today.

The only one I see being any trouble is the line I commented out in E4Application. On my work computer that produced a compile error and Eclipse would not run without commenting it out. I suspect this is caused by incompatible plugin versions.

I may have to test every change except that one and then commit that change without testing it."

If that's the case then just ignore that one change.  I can make it before submitting your fix.

We currently have no plans to change this.

The problem is that the only way you're going to get rich enough conditions
for enablement is to allow arbitrary Java code to be run.
Which means activating the plugin just to determine whether the action is
enabled or not.
Eclipse tries very hard to avoid starting plugins unnecessarily, to keep
startup time down.
E.g., if I'm editing text and not editing HTML, it should not have to
activate any part of the HTML plugin.

	We shouldn't install a Save action in the TextMergeViewer if the viewer is enclosed in a CompareEditor.
	In this case all modification are done on the editor's buffer.
	In the VCMSyncView a Save is needed since VCM UI doesn't support a buffered model.

AW (07.06.01 18:45:07)
	Since the CompareEditor will be replaced by a CompareViewer or dialog I suggest not to allow buffered
	editing and make the  CompareEditor readonly. This is easily done by enabling the two lines:
		cc.setLeftEditable(false);
		cc.setRightEditable(false);

some unexpected behaviour.

Steps:
(this must be done in Win32 OS)
1) new project
2) create a new file 'pic.bmp' (this will open its OLE editor)
3) draw a stick man in the editor
4) in the Navigator view, delete pic.bmp

At this point, pic.bmp is deleted from the Navigator and from the system but the OLE
editor is still open.  If you close the OLE editor now and choose to 'Save changes',
the file will be re-added to the Navigator.

You can get the same type of behaviour if you are using the 'System Editor', but Eclipse
can't be expected to retain control over apps outside of its domain.  I imagine Eclipse should
be able to close a file's associated OLE editor when deleted however (and also bypass the
'Save changes?' dialog which is always automatic for manual closes).

	the problme is that JFace text is not designed to be accessible from multiple threads. This is 
	consistent with JFace.
	Workaround is to call the progress monitor with fork=false.
	This has the negative consequence that the operaiton runs in the UI thread and cannot
	be cancelled.

1) create a new file with .ppt extension
2) the ole editor will appear for the ppt.  Do not close the editor.

4) run eclipse

When eclipse loads, the OLE editor loads inside eclipse but an instance of PowerPoint will also
appear.  This problem does not occur with any other programs.

NOTES:

TC (6/12/01 10:05:23 AM) - this is because there are multiple shows being shown in this case -
as there are two instances of power point power point will use the main one outside of

	I'm not sure I understand to what part of compare you are referring to.

	There are lots of ways to navigate through the changes:
	- every pane has next/previous buttons to step through the changes shown in the pane
	- in the tree viewer you can step through changes by means of the cursor keys
	- in the text compare viewer next/previous button first step through line changes and then through token changes
	- the compare browser has next/previous toolbar items (and cntr-n/cntr-p shortcuts) to step through the changes across panes;
		so it will go the the next resource if you've reached the end of the changes in that resource.

Steps to repeat:
1) in a project with at least 2 files, select them both
2) right click and select 'Compare With -> Each Other'

When files within a project are added or removed outside of the Workbench, or when an external editor is used to modify a file within a project, a manual 
refresh must be done in order for the changes to show up in the Workbench.  This is also needed for the changes to show up as outgoing changes when

NOTES:

DS (6/12/01 12:01:36 PM)
	Here is the offending code ..

	public IEditorPart openEditor(IMarker marker, boolean activate) 
		throws PartInitException 
	{
		// Get the resource.
		IFile file = (IFile)marker.getResource();		<------ according to exception
		..
	}

	Problem 1: I suspect this exception occurs because the result of getResource is an
	IProject, not an IFile.

	The marker target is a class file in an external jar.  There is no underlying resource for the 
	class file, so I would guess that the java team is hanging the marker on the project itself.  
	Thus, getResource returns an IProject rather than an IFile.  

	If the getResource result is not an IFile there is no way for the workbench to 
	determine the editor input.  IMarker does not provide API to support the scenario.

	Solution: check type of getResource result.  If not IFile show error dialog and return.

	Problem 2: The marker shouldn't even exist.  As stated above, IMarker doesn't provide
	API to get the real marker target.  Our own AddBookmarkAction does not support the
	creation of bookmarks on non-IFiles, so the java team must be defining another 
	bookmark action to bookmark class files.  This is an error.  The packages view 
	should not allow bookmarking on class files.

EG (6/12/2001 7:09:23 AM)
	the real problem is described here 1G8SCA9: ITPUI:ALL - Cannot open breakpoint on external jar 
	This problem will not be fixable so we have to investigate in workarounds.
	Changing the Add book mark action in the packages view is no problem. However, it isn't
	enough we can also create book marks in the Class File editor. 
	Tasks will have the same problem, need to verify.

TC (6/12/01 8:31:42 AM) - it looks to me like you were running without the create directory structure

selected everything white selected is exported flat - that is directories and thier children or 
just white selected files.

However we have decided that exporting a white checked directory should always result in that
directory showing up. Now createDirectoryStructure should create all folders including the 
project.

o       Implemented. No significant changes expected but we will respond to customer feedback.

...

	- Task list drag and drop: The task list supports the following transfer types: marker, text.  Tasks and
	problems can be dragged to any OLE component that supports text transfer (such as Microsoft Word),
	to produce a textual task report.  IMarkers can be dragged from the task list to any views that support
	marker dropping (currently none). 
--------------------------------------------------

The feature is documented as being implemented but it is not.  The Plan should be updated if it will not
be implemented so that it does not end up as part of Eclipse documentaton.

The up arrow I understand but I think that the right arrow means 
go into and the left go out of. 
In fact it is possible to get them to do just the opposite.

Perhaps the problem is that what the left or right arrows will
do at any given time depends on some invisible history.
Just looking at the visible state of the navigator you have no
idea what these buttons will do (without checking the button
hover-help).

Perhaps another problem is that the left right arrows look the
same as the up arrow but their functionality is completely different.
The up arrow is ""move relative to current location""
The left-right arrows are ""move to to some abitrary location in the history""

depends on org.eclipse.ui. If the browser code gets moved elsewhere to avoid 
dependency cycles, things should be relatively ok.

There are a couple of issues that you need to be aware of:

On Windows, help does not use a full-fledged web browser. It just wraps the 
existing IE5 ActiveX control.
On Unix platforms, we are using the system browser, but the issue there is that 
when multiple clients call the browser the code may reuse the existing browser, 
which means that if someone has Help open, and then calls the Eclipse corner 
page, it will likely replace the help content with the new URL.

Take a look at the org.eclipse.help.ui.browser extension point.
Help is providing browser adapters (usually one per platform, but one can plug 
different ones) and you can use them to launch external links.

running in another process. You may want to just call browser launching code

be rid of it.

STEPS
	1) Create a project Foo whose location is your CD ROM drive
	2) Select delete on Foo. It will ask if you want to delete the contents from the file system.
	3) Say no - you will now get prompted for each one being deleted.
	4) No matter what you cannot get rid of Foo


NOTES:

TC (6/12/01 1:49:17 PM) - interestingly this works fine if you choose to do the same thing on a 
read only file on the file system. Just select yes to deletion and it deletes the resource but
leaves the file alone.

SA (10/10/2001 10:34:40 AM)
	In build 0.202, this problem still exist. Here some more details on what is going on. When
	a project is created and its location points to a read-only directory (and all files contained in
	the directory is read-only), the equivalent resouces are created in the workspace with the
	read-only flag on. So when you delete the project, the first dialog prompts if you want to delete
	the actual files and directories in the file system. The next prompt you get is if you want to
	delete the read-only resource project in the workspace (you also get prompted for all
	the resources in the project if they are read-only also).

	I guess the confusion comes from the message in the prompts? I too was fooled
	the first time I ran this. At the very least, we need to update the messages in the
	prompts (maybe add the words ""project"" or ""workspace resource"", etc). Or maybe
	we should change how this is presented to the user? (no ideas at the moment of
	course)."

opens with the root / directory selected (checked),

the root / directory checked along with all of the leaves,

	This looks like a workbench problem. PDE's editor contributor should only receive 
	its own editor in 'setActiveEditor'. Instead, workbench is passing me some 'ErrorEditorPage' and
	there is a class cast exception.

	I am not sure, but this should not happen (only editor instances of the type registered together
	with the contributor should be passed to the contributor using 'setActiveEditor' method). Moving
	to ITPUI for comment.

DS (6/12/01 6:22:20 PM)
	In EditorManager.openInternalEditor we should check to see if editor creation fails.
	We can probably query the PartPane.  If so, get rid of the editor completely and 
	show a dialog to the user ( if not in startup ).


KH (6/12/2001 8:14:59 PM)
	Why did the editor fail to open in the first place? 

DS (6/13/01 1:01:43 PM)
	If an exception occurs during part creation it is usually logged.  That log appears to
	be missing from this PR, so there is no way to know.  I have asked DG.

DS (6/13/01 1:08:41 PM)
	Cannot dupe the original scenario.

	There are two problems here.

	1. PDEEditor fails to open correctly.
	2. Workbench fails to deal with it correctly.

	I have logged a PR in ITPPDE for the first one,
		1GF9VS5: ITPPDE:ALL - NPE in Plugin Editor
	and will address the second in this PR.

DS (6/13/01 5:00:44 PM)
	In this scenario we replace the editor part with an error part and then call 
	setActiveEditor(errorPart) on the plugin editor action bar contributor.  A class cast 
	exception occurs when the contributor tries to cast this to a plugin editor.  

	In general, I think a contributor can assume that the argument for setActiveEditor is
	the editor type it is paired with in the registry.  Therefore, the workbench behavior is incorrect.
	To fix, we should deref the editor action bar contributor in the same
	way as we deref the editor part itself.  This will avoid the communication problem.

	Test fix in

The current frame is now persisted if there is one other than the default or 
workspace root frame. If no frame is persisted the navigator expanded state and 
selection is saved like before.

When the navigator is restored the frame is restored and set in the navigator. 
This automatically creates a frame history. Going back in the history goes to 
the workspace root with the last frame input selected and no other elements 
expanded.

SA (6/14/2001 4:07:07 PM)
	Just my two cents having investigated this a couple of months ago...
	(the agreement at the time was to leave things as they were)

	The term Rebuild All and Build have meaning to those outside of VA Java
	land (those working with C++ and other Java IDEs that require you to compile)
	All of them know what these mean.

	The problem is with the menu bar item Project which is supposed to
	represent all projects in the workspace. In other words, menu items
	in this Project menu are applied to all resources in the workspace.

	What do the usuability studies say (from Julian)?

	Also, what do you call Build action when auto-build is off? ""Build Project""?
	Now users are confused with ""Rebuild Project"" and ""Build Project"".

EG (6/14/2001 11:02:17 AM)	
	NE> Agree.  Should work the same as the packages view.
	another difference is that in the packages view the build project
	also shows in the menu when you select a child of the project.

	Hi Andre, from usability discussions, they thought the ""copy selected nodes from left to right"" buttons
	in the structure view were confusing.  They really mimic the catchup/release menu items when in the catchup/release view.  
	Maybe they shouldn't appear in the structure view toolbar, but just in the context menu.
	That way, I can exclude them completely from the catchup/release view. 
	They would only appear in the context menu of other compare editors, where they make more sense. 
	Currently there is a confusing array of operations for copying things from local->server and vice-versa, and it seems confusing."

Randy, based on my investigation, this is a tricky problem to get correct.  I 
was looking at using a timer to trigger the rename operation in order to deal 
with the double click vs. single selection of the same item.  

There are problems with the current released implementation.  The 
implementation should work like the explorer does in windows (i.e. only invoke 
the inline rename when a click on the label of an already selected item 
occurs). 

1) Go to resources perspective.  Select a project in the navigator.  Expand the 
project by clicking on the plus icon.  The inline rename operation is invoked 
when it should not be.
2) Go to resources perspective.  Double click on a resource to invoke its 
editor.  Click on the navigator view.  The inline rename operation is invoked 
when it should not be.
3) Invoke the inline rename operation.  Click anywhere outside of the edit 
widget.  This should end the rename operation (by virtue of the edit widget 
losing focus).

There is also a general problem with ending the rename operation.  If you click 
to the right of the item being renamed on the same line, the operation is not 
ended.  It should be.  This has to do with the fact that the edit widget is 
spanning the entire width of the navigator.  

Also note that there are Linux/non-Win issues to consider when doing this.  
Loss of focus works differently on Linux and focus can be customized (e.g., set 
to follow the mouse), so you need to make sure that any Windows solution does 
not break other platform rules.  For example, in Windows when you click on the 
NavigatorView, the edit widget loses focus.  In Linux this is not the case.  I 
tried a fix for the above problem by setting focus to the NavigatorView on 
mouse down (so the edit would end), but this solution is incorrect for Linux."

I agree, I might move this to the CommonNavigator.  I just took over ownership of the Navigator, which means I just say that we won't do anything with it, as it's essentially replayed by the CNF.

When you select an open editor via the Navigator or Packages views, it will become visible
but not active.  This is probably the desired behaviour but the only problem is if you try
to do an editor action (such as Close) it will close the last active editor, not the current
visible one.  This can be a bit confusing but is not major.

Steps:
1) create file 'abc', the editor should become visible and active
2) create file 'xyz', the editor should become visible and active
3) click on 'abc' in the navigator, notice that abc's editor becomes visible but not active
4) File > Close (or Ctrl+F4)
xyz closes, you would have expected abc to close.

II.
When you do a drag-and-drop operation on an editor to split up the editors, the editor
is shown as active but the Close operation does not affect it.
Steps:
1) create file 'abc', the editor should become visible and active
2) create file 'xyz', the editor should become visible and active
3) grab the title bar of 'abc' and drag it to an edge thus spliting up the editor workspace
	- do this in one action (do not select it before moving)
4) File > Close
'xyz' close, 'abc' should have closed

Page Designer has following Save menu items:

[File]->[Save]
([File]->[Save As...])
[File]->[Save All]
[File]->[Save Frame]->[Save All Frames]
([File]->[Save Frame]->[Save Frames As...])

These are the same items in Studio Classic and Homepage Builder,
and, in HTML frame editing mode, these items have following functions:

[File]->[Save] ([Save As...])
   Save a current focused html file only.
   (i.e. If the focus is in a child frame, only the child frame page will be saved.)

[File]->[Save All]
   Save all documents (The same as current eclipse.)

[File]->[Save Frame]->[Save All Frames]([Save Frames As...])
   Save active editor's  top frame and its child frames.

Note that [Save] and [Save All] save different files.

However, the eclipse framework call the same doSave() function
to both [Save] and [Save All].  Page Designer needs to distinguish these two menu item 
to support HTML frame file.  

Implementing this would also re	quire the ability to specify the text that appears
on the save menu item so that we could tailor this to be only the active frame.

It seems some obvious functionality is missing from IWorkbench. We need to
know when a new workbench window is opened or an existing one closed. For
example:

IWorkbench.addWorkbenchListener(IWorkbenchListener)

IWorkbenchListener would contain, among other methods,
windowOpened(IWorkbenchWindow)
windowClosed(IWorkbenchWindow)
etc...


I've found a workaround. However, this is very ugly and it would be great if
someone could give an estimate when real listener support could be added to
IWorkbench. I'm adding a ShellListener to the current WorkbenchWindow's
shell. When I get a shellDeactivated, I check to see what the
activeWorkBenchWindow is. If its not the original window, I know I've got a
new one. I've discovered I must do the check in an asyncExec, because at the
time shellDeactivated is called, the original workbench window is still the
active one.

foreground color.  Doing so leads to a lot of unnecessary StyleRange objects.  Also, when the user is

foreground color.  SEF should investigate changing this.  Doing so will improve performance of the Java

2537,lynne_kues@us.ibm.com,2002-03-19T13:35:06Z,2,0,"I believe there is major potential here for performance improvements.  If the 
java editor took advantage of the default foreground color and used this for 
it's ""other"" style (i.e., what non java tokens are colored), the number of 
style ranges that are created and set would be significantly reduced.  I ran 
some numbers and it's on the order of 50% less.  These are the number of styles 
created for some CUs.  The ""not needed"" number is the number of styles where 
the foreground, background, and font style are the same as the widget's values 
for these (i.e., no need to create a style in this instance).

set styles range size 29291 (not needed 10721)
set styles range size 2806 (not needed 1094)
set styles range size 17698 (not needed 8662)
set styles range size 29291 (not needed 10721)

Less styles is better.  When styles are added/removed the styles array has to 
be manipulated to accomodate the change.  Also, every time a text change 
occurs, the styles have to be updated to account for the change.  And so on.  I 
think this change should be considered."
2537,lynne_kues@us.ibm.com,2002-03-19T15:44:50Z,3,0,"Probably the easiest way to do this would be to get rid of the ""other"" concept 
as a settable thing and instead have it be the editor's default text style and 
foreground color."
2537,lynne_kues@us.ibm.com,2002-04-25T15:32:40Z,4,0,"Updating this to include the typing scenario that I found in the Java Editor.

During typing setStyleRange is being called each time a character is typed, 
such that typing a word like ""public"" will cause 6 redraws to occur as follows:

	p
	pu
	pub
	publ
	publi
	public

In this case, it would be more efficient to call setStyleRange just once (i.e., 
when a word actually does get a style).  I'm not sure how hard that would be to 
do, but one thing that seems easy would be to not call setStyleRange if the 
style is not different than the defaults for the widget (related to the PR 
above).  That would cut down on the number of redraws.

If I continue with the above example and type ""void"", during each redraw of the 
characters in void, ""public"" is also getting redrawn.  So void leads to 8 
redraws:

	public
	v
	public
	vo
	public
	voi
	public
	void

And then if I continue and type ""test"", I get 12 redraws (and so on):

	public
	void
	t
	public
	void
	te
	public
	void
	tes
	public
	void
	test

So that's a total of 26 setStyleRange calls (and 26 redraws) that could - in 
the most optimized case - be handled with 3 setStyleRanges (and 3 redraws)."

Abstract : keyboard doesn't suit for editing attribute on Properties view

Problem Description : Keyboard doesn't seem suited for editing attribute on the Properties view.
Combination of Esc + cursor up/down are required every time when to move other attribute's value besides just above or under

Misc. Information :
  Reported by :  Y. Yamanashi

  Date :  06/13/2001 (mm/dd/yyyy)
  Frequency :  S  (""S""olid / ""I""ntermittent problem)

  Environment :
    OS : Windows 2000

                    wsa-jdk-20010614_1300-107-119


  Current implementation is ;
    1. clicking the property or its value makes the value is selected and editable
    2. esc key is required to cancel its editing mode
    3. up or down arrow key allow cursor movement to up or down by one line and the value, where cursor has just located on, is now editable.
        So multiple Esc + arrow key operation is required to edit the property's value located far from the one where the cursor located first.

  On the other hand, on the ordinary spreadsheet application, like Lotus 123 or Microsoft Exel, or on the Explore of Windows, a user can  
  move cursor only using up/arrow key to the place where a user wants to edit. Then a user presses some key, such as F2, to be able to edit that item.

  So at the point of the usability, keyboard should be more suited for editing attribute on the Properties view.

The current implementation seems OK to me as far as navigation goes; it works 
this way:

When no CE is active you can arrow up / down without activating the editor 
(which appears to be the original problem). Hitting 'Enter' (or a direct mouse 
click) activates the CE and then either Esc (to cancel) or Enter (to set) will 
generally get you back to the 'inactive' state.

The one exception to this flow in our CE's is the DialogCellEditor which stays 
active once the value has been set so the flow is:

Enter (activates)
Enter (opens dialog)
<fiddle with dialog>
Enter (to accept)
Esc (the ONLY way to dismiss the CE)

[ soapbox on... ]

I'd personally like to see the CE deactivate once the dialog has been closed 
(since the User has made their changes or cancelled). This would bring it into 
closer alignment with the other CE's. A fully consistent DialogCE would not 
have a button to open the dialog it; would simply open the dialog on activate 
and deactivate once the dialog has been closed, making its flow match the 
others exactly...

1. Developers need an ability to enable their actions with greater accuracy.  
2. The action delegate should be instantiated when the plugin is loaded.

The original post :

Hello,

I have a popup menu action that I need to sometimes have disabled and
sometimes enabled when my plugin is started.

Currently, I disable the popup menu action in the selectionChanged
method of my action class, but I need for this logic to be executed
before it executes the action (when the plugin is started) in order to
avoid executing the action and having a message box being displayed:
""The chosen operation is not currently available."".  After this happens,
the menu action is disabled.  How can I do this?

Miriam Ford
IBM, Voice Systems Development

Response :

Miriam,

Before your plugin is started the action enablement is controlled by XML. 
When your plugin is started the action enablement is re-evaluated when a
new selection occurs in the workbench.  Not before.  At this point your
action delegate will be instantiated and you can run your own enablement
code.  

Under what conditions should the action be disabled?  Is it possible to
describe those conditions using the <selection> attributes of an
ObjectContribution?  Note: the extension point is documented within the
Platform Plugin Developers Guide (see Ref / Extensions / Workbench).

Dave Springgay

Response:

Hi Dave,

The condition in which the action would be disabled is based on a product
(that my action is dependent on) being found in the system.  I have some code
that checks an environment variable that is set by this product, and if this
variable is not found, then the action shouldn't be enabled.

	Additional Request from Miriam ..

Hi David,

Is there a way that I can display my own message (""This functionality is not
available because Product XXX is not installed"") instead of the generic
message that currently appears (""The chosen operation is not currently
available."")?

This generic message appears when calling action.setEnabled(false) from my
action's selectionChanged() method .

Thanks for your help."

NOTES:

NE (7/5/01 11:01:26 AM)
	EC reply:

Unfortunately the TableViewer (and TableTreeViewer) hardcodes the delay and
the double-click (non-)behaviour,  in the TableViewerImpl class.  See
TableViewerImpl.handleMouseDown(MouseEvent) and
handleMouseDoubleClick(MouseEvent).
These are called by the listener in TableViewer.hookControl().

You might be able to fake it out by hooking selection or mouse events on the
Table widget, and calling TableViewer.editElement(Object element, int
column).  You'll need to determine which column was selected by checking
bounds of the various columns in the
selected item.  See TableViewerImpl.activateCellEditor(MouseEvent) for how
it normally does this.
You can get the element from the TableItem using getData() (although this is
an internal implementation detail).
However, if you do hook these events, the TableViewerImpl will still be
doing its own handling, so you may have some strange interactions with the
default behaviour.

The only other alternative currently is to not set the cell editors in the
viewer, but handle editing yourself (create your own TableEditor).
You could still use the cell editors, but you would have control over when
they are activated, rather than TableViewerImpl.
This is a bit more work, but would give you the most control."

.* CMVC Problem Description Form for Eclipse Studio V4.1

Abstract : Frame-Source:click list box then click source area fakes regional selection

Component : PD - Source/Frame

Problem Description : Clicking drop-down list box of the files then clicking any place on the Source area fakes regional selection.
Any operation, like pressing [Delete] key or Ctrl+X, doesn't affect on the regional selection on the Source area.
And the drop-down list box of the files still has focus on itself, so cursor up/down makes changing list of the file.

Misc. Information :
  Reported by :  Y. Yamanashi

  Date :  06/28/2001 (mm/dd/yyyy)
  Frequency :  S  (""S""olid / ""I""ntermittent problem)

  Environment :
    OS : Windows 2000 & Windows NT
    Eclipse build : wsa-jdk-20010627_1300-R09-R09
                       wsa-jdk-20010628_1300-R09-R09

  Re-creation Proc. :
    1. open the frame set file
    2. click the Source tab to show Source view
    3. click drop-down list box of the file
    4. click anywhere on the source area
    5. then regional selection is made on the Source view, 
    6. the file name in the drop-down list box still is reversed, i.e. is focused on
    7. press [Delete] key, Ctrl+X, but nothing occurs, i.e. the regional selection is not real one.
    8. press cursor up or down key, then the regional selection disappears and selected file is shown in the Source view

This problem seems to be a bug of SWT.
org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditor highlights a region even though
org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo is getting focus.

I will create a sample code, then I will assign this defect to OTI.
Old Abstract: Frame:click list box then source area fakes regional selection
New Abstract: OTI: click list box then source area fakes regional selection



    <Note by takes (Takeda, Shigefumi), 2001/07/06 11:38:40, seq: 4 rel: 0  action: assign>
The following code which TestEditor shows Combo and TextEditor causes the same problem:

  public class TestEditor extends TextEditor {
    public TextEditor() {
        super();
    }
    public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
        ViewForm form = new ViewForm(parent, SWT.NONE);
        Combo combo = new Combo(form, SWT.READ_ONLY);
        form.setTopRight(combo);
        Composite compo = new Composite(form, SWT.NONE);
        compo.setLayout(new FillLayout());
        super.createPartControl(compo);
        form.setContent(compo);
    }
  }

Instructions:
  1.  Open TestEditor
  2.  Click somewhere in the edit area
  3.  Open the combo (not select any item; just open it)
  4.  Click somewhere in the edit area of TestEditor
  5.  Then, TestEditor is highlighting a region(clicked from 2. to 4.)
       even though the combo is getting focus.

TextEditor should not highlight a region in the edit area if Combo is getting focus.

Sorry, I wrote wrong sample code as follows:

6.  Property sheet: up/down arrow causes an internal error
   (1GGM4ZB: ITPJUI:ALL) This is an exception when arrow keys are used in a
   combo cell editor.  It is a very visible bug that should not be hard to
   fix.

ARCH (7/11/01 10:55:53 AM)
	Fix for 1.0

RG (7/16/01 10:27:09 AM)
	
Issues:
1. The html element is clearing its property descriptors when it is edited (either in the 
html editor or via the property sheet). When a new value is set in the property sheet the
property sheet will refresh the descriptors and in this case it is getting a new descriptor
for the property being edited. Since the descriptor provides the cell editor the old 
cell editor is being disposed which leads to the problem.

In general 
a) Property souces should not replace the descriptor being edited in the property sheet.
It is valid to add or remove other descriptors when a value changes but we do not
expect to lose the descriptor whose value is being changed.
b) The property sheet should be refreshed if the descriptors change as a result of a change
made via the resource editor (ex. html editor). 

2. The combo box cell editor is firing an applyEditorValue with every selection in the 
the combo box list. It should only be doing this when the user makes a ""real"" selection.
Simply navigating the list should not not cause an applyEditorValue.

NE (07/16/01 2:07:02 PM)
	Advised GPD to change client code.

RG (7/17/01 3:35:17 PM)
	Re 2. above, in order to fix this we need:
	1GH0W4N: SWT:ALL - DCR: CCombo should fire a default selection event
	We currently have no way to tell if a selection in the combo is a ""real""
	selection (enter key or mouse click) or a selection simply caused by 
	scrolling through the list.

GDA (8/1/01 4:26:42 PM)
	Is GDC changing his code ? Is this closed from his perspective?
	Are we awaiting the fix mentioned above from swt & planning to make our fix and theirs for 1.0.
	Does swt know the above is required to address this fully.

DMW (8/2/2001 1:37:18 PM)
	I have reopened the defect from our (WSAD) side. The suggestions above seem reasonable, 
 	so we'll look at solving using those. I will report back what we find.

NE (8/2/01 1:49:16 PM)
	DMW adds:
		I don't know enough off the top of my head to know if the 2
		recommendations/issues can be solved on our side, but seems fairly likely.
		I would appreciate the issue remain ""open"" until we know for sure.

RG (8/3/01 1:23:01 PM)
	In org.eclipse.swt.custom.CCombo.textEvent(Event) a single SWT.KeyDown event is generating
	two callbacks to the listeners. I think SWT should check to see of the widget is disposed after
	issuing the first callback.
	The following change prevents the problem

				if (oldIndex != getSelectionIndex ()) {
					Event e = new Event();
					e.time = event.time;
					notifyListeners(SWT.Selection, e);
					// If widget has been disposed, return
					if (isDisposed())
						return;
				}

	Entered 1GHWA19: SWT:WINNT - Problem with callbacks from CCombo

1. Startup Eclipse on a new workspace
2. Change Preferences->Workbench->Perspectives->Open a new perspective->In a 
new window
3. Open Java perspective
4. Exit Eclipse
5. Retstart Eclipse on the same workspace
Observe: The Resource perspective opens first on top of the splash screen while 
the Java perspective is opening."
2578,kcornell@ca.ibm.com,2002-09-20T14:12:32Z,6,0,"Thank you for providing the steps. If the user had three or four windows opened 
when a session was ended, the delay in the opening would be worse and all 
windows would eventually cover the splash window. The problem is related to the 
fact that Eclipse itself and the splash window are in separate processes. 
Within one process, you can problably keep one window always on top (e.g., like 
a modal dialog) but in separate processes, you are at the mercy of OS window 
manager.

There are probably several possible solutions:

1. The launcher could try to keep its splash window always on top, regardless 
of new windows being created (much like the Task Manager window stays on top). 
This is NOT recommended because while Eclipse is starting up (especially on a 
slow machine) the user would be unable to do anything else because the middle 
of his screen would be obscured by the splash window. This would really be 
annoying for Eclipse developers trying to debug the startup sequence. (As a 
note, the Visual Studio splash window can be obscured by the user if he brings 
some other application to the top.)

2. After the first window is finished being created, the launcher could be 
terminated by Eclipse. Although, this leaves an inactive top level window that 
is visible (since Eclipse is still creating the other windows), the wait cursor 
is shown, indicating Eclipse is still busy. The splash screen is really no 
longer needed at this point because at least one Eclipse window is visible and 
populated (with views) and the user knows the product is running. 

3. Eclipse could try to determine the window ID of the splash window and keep 
bringing it to the top after it creates each of its windows. Since the splash 
window is created by a separate process (the launcher), this would require some 
interprocess communication (between a C application and Java) which would be 
prone to timing problems. It adds an extra level of complexity to the startup 
sequence with very little gain.

In my opinion, option 2 above appears to be the simplest (or do nothing at all).
If so, this bug would need to be transfered to a different component (i.e., 
core).

Mike/Kevin H.: Do you have any other suggestions or opinions?"

Veronika hacked it and is using it because she couldn't stand it anymore, 
particularly when using her laptop where screen real estate is at a premium.
I am using it now, too, and it is SO NICE. What a relief!

It is a very simple fix - you only have to delete a bit of code in 2 methods.
Please please do this, because it is ""low-hanging fruit"", i.e. very easy to do 
and a *huge* win.

1) Go to class: org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorWorkbook
2) In method zoomIn() comment out the following lines of code:
	// Remove each tab but the active.
	if (tabFolder != null) {
		// Get active editor.
		CTabItem activeTab = tabFolder.getSelection();
		if (activeTab == null)
			return;

		// Hide all inactive tabs.
		Object [] tabArray = mapTabToEditor.keySet().toArray();
		for (int nX = 0; nX < tabArray.length; nX ++) {
			CTabItem tab = (CTabItem)tabArray[nX];
			if (tab != activeTab)
				removeTab(tab);
		}
	}
3) In method zoomOut() comment out the following lines of code:
	// Create a tab for each inactive editor.
	if (tabFolder != null) {
		int count = 0;
		Iterator enum = editors.iterator();
		while (enum.hasNext()) {
			EditorPane part = (EditorPane) enum.next();
			if (part != visibleEditor)
				createTab(part, count);
			++ count;
		}
	}
That's all! Try it for a while, and then go delete the commented out code. You 
will like it - it is much nicer for zooming. This fix has many advantages. It 
reduces the number of lines of code (always a good thing), and it is faster 
(not visually, I suppose, but obviously it does save a millisecond or so), and 
it deletes an ill-concieved ""feature"" that never should have been there in the 
first place. It reduces the number of steps to perform a very common operation 
from 3 down to 1. It eliminates the need for the user to context switch from 
big to small to big again. It removes a large level of frustration when using 
the product.

 Description:  
Steps to reproduce:

-> create file foo.txt 
-> select Save As from file menu 
-> type new file name and specify location 
-> do not specify file extension 
-> select OK
Result: 
Saved As model is not a txt file any more, it looks like it is saved as xml file. 

Expected: I think that our user would expect by default Save As should as the original extension.

Headline:  Workbench Properties view columns should always ""fit"" the window. 
 
Description:  It is possible to shrink the width of the pb window so that the value column isn't completely 
showing. If the user selects an enum, bool, or a property that has a property page when this is the case,
 the ""..."" button or drop-down button doesn't show. This erroneously gives the user a sense that there is 
no button associated with the property unless he or she happens to expand the pb enough to see the end of the value 
column. 

""Property Browser ""Value"" column can be hidden if Property Browser is sized too small"" 
Steps to reproduce: 

1) Start the WSW 
2) Size the property browser such that the ""Value"" column is not showing 

Result: 
If the property browser is sized such that the value column is not completely displayed, the user 
would not be aware of the properties that have values that can be selected via a drop down list. 

As the PB is resized, it should always show 2 columns if possible.

the developer would like to control the order that they are displayed on the Preferences page. 

The desired order is:

Specifying this order in the plugin.xml failed to produce the desired ordering. 
It is not clear how the items are being sorted or how to change the ordering.

RG (7/16/01 4:44:01 PM)
	Plugins don't own their subtree. Anyone can specify the same subtree. The plugin.xml which
	will be read first is unpredicatable. Thus we collect all the items in a subtree from
	all plugins and sort them alphabetically.

	Currently we allow a page to specify a parent category. A solution might be to allow a page
	to specify an ""order after"" category (this category would be a sibling). All pages in a subtree without
	an ""order after"" category would be sorted alphabetically. Pages with an ""order after"" category would
	then be inserted after their specified category. Any conflicts (>1 page with the same ""order after"" category)
	would be resolved by alphabetical ordering.

	It is important that page ordering be deterministic independent of plugin.xml read order."

the accessibility issues in Eclipse.  Here were some notes that Jean-Michel
and I made about the compare framework:

arrows distinguising change direction are very small (visibility issue).
within a text file, incoming, outgoing and conflicting changes are represented in either red, 
blue, or black.  This may be a colour/low visibility issue.  Even blue vs. black may be difficult 
to distinguish

compare editors don't even read the text to you using MS Narrator.  I would like to 
try this with JAWS to see if it can read it.  It is doubtful that it will work because it's 
a custom widget.

GDA> Jaws cannot read it in a meaningful way. It reads a line at the left, line at the right, 
	line at the left, back to a line at the right. So multi line changes are brutal.

changes are represented graphically with lines and arrows, which doesn't translate to speech.
all compare actions are in toolbars only.  As far as we know there is no way to access these 
toolbars without a mouse.  This issue is actually pretty complex, because a compare view is 
composed of panes that may be contributed by different plugins, and they don't know about 
each other.  Not trivial to just add all these actions to the context menu.

compare FW sometimes spontaneously changes focus between tree and editor.  
This messes with screen readers and magnifiers, which rely heavily on widget focus.

NOTES:

The import wizard does not parse the .java files.  This is mainly because the Zip import functionality 
(which also handles Jars), is not specifically tied to the Java support in JDT.  
It's a general workbench feature, which would be there even if you didn't have JDT installed.  
It just imports the files with no parsing.
VAME was smarter because its import was Java-specific.

It would help to have an option in the Zip import for specifying a prefix to ignore; ""a"" in your case.  I've filed a PR for this.
This would be similar to how you can specify a prefix when associating a source zip with your jar for debugging.

In the mean time, your only recourse is to import it, allowing ""a"" to be created, then move ""b"" up one level 
and delete the empty ""a""."

We should support a ""dynamic editor"" option/mode
When an editor is open in dynamic mode then it changes its input based on the selection

Thus one could open a single java editor and easily browse code by selecting different .java files

If the editor contains unsaved changes and you select another file you would be prompted to 
a) save the changes
b) open another editor
c) cancel
In the case of b, the old editor becomes ""static"" with its current input and the new editor is the dynamic one.

	How is the dynamic option set?

I had not made any changes to it on disk, and I'm running off of a local hard drive, so nobody else had either.

Not sure if this is a Core problem, or is due to the way text editors check timestamps (they fake out Core).

   (Not sure of PR #) We have many editors that have supporting views.
   Page Designer is a great example of this.  The ""web"" perspective has
   Thumbnail, Gallery, and Color Palette views that are used very closely
   with the PageDesigner Editor.  When these views are activated, the
   PageDesigner gets deactivated and all of its toolbar contributions are
   removed.  Since Page Designer has 3 rows of toolbar icons when its
   toolbar gets deactivated all of the views in the perspective re-layout.
   This makes it almost impossible to use the color palette and very
   difficult to use the Thumbnail view.  To really appreciate the severity
   of this problem, you have to see it.

	at least there could be a message given or left in log, or something. Perhaps the

JohnA (10/3/2001 3:10:09 PM)
	All the core event loop can do is print the exception to the console, which is what it does.
	Since eclipse doesn't have a console by default, users typically don't see this.  If we
	want to do any more logging, it will have to be done in the Workbench event loop.
	It's probably possible to write to the log after an OutOfMemoryError, since the stack
	frame that consumed the memory is probably gone.  Workbench#runEventLoop
	could consider doing this:

	...
	} catch (VirtualMachineError e) {
		//we're going down anyway, might as well try to log it
		String msg = e.getMessage() == null ? e.toString() : e.getMessage();

On a related note, two difference sizes are used for wizards: 470x550 and 500x500.
(the first for import/export, the latter for new resources/projects)
Just a suggestion but maybe we should be more consistent by providing a standard
wizard size as Static ints in the WizardDialog class.  We could take this one step further
by adding a method setMinimumSize() that simply sets the dimensions as a minimum size.
This would give wizards a consistent look and feel but would only be optional.

JEL (25/07/2001 11:40:21 AM)
RE: 14) The problem here is that the button widths are calculated on the average character size
of the font used.  This is sufficient in most cases.  For the rare case where there are many
fat characters, the estimation will not be large enough.  We can add a safety measure that will
expand the individual button if the estimation is too small.

ex: 	buttonData.widthHint = Math.max(buttonWidth, deselectButton.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT,SWT.DEFAULT, true).x);
This applies to classes: org.eclipse.ui.wizards.datatransfer::WizardFileSystemResourceImportPage,
and WizardExportResourcesPage
The button will be slightly larger than the other buttons, but at least the text will show.

RE: 7i, 8i, 9, 10) The size is being set, we should check to make sure it is not smaller than the calculated size.

ex: Point size = dialog.getShell().getSize();
	dialog.getShell().setSize( Math.max(SIZING_WIZARD_WIDTH, size.x), Math.max(SIZING_WIZARD_HEIGHT, size.y) );
This applies to classes: org.eclipse.ui.internal::NewProjectAction, ImportResourcesAction, and ExportResourcesAction,
and org.eclipse.ui.actions::NewWizardAction,

	Changes verified by DS.

NE (8/30/01 11:42:16 AM)
	7ii and 8ii are due to the table column not getting resized.

SA (9/13/2001 12:16:06 PM)
	For 2, some of the fields would need to be moved. I suggest that the
	the text field for ""Where description"" label be placed under the label
	indented a bit. Do the same for ""Where problem severity is"", ""Where
	task priority is"" and ""Where task status is"" - that is, move the check boxes
	that are to the right of these labels to under the label (indented a bit)

	For 7ii and 8ii, the column width is fix. Instead of using ColumnPixelData
	we should use a ColumnWeightData to take-up the whole table width.

	For 11, 12, 13 it seems a font file problem after talking with Tod. Tod
	has proposed possible font files that could be used for Japanese - Kevin

to eclipse.
This is the scenario :
- I have tree views A, B, C opened in that order, one on top of each other.
- Select view B and do some work on it
- Select view C, do some work than close C
- At this point I expect B to be the visible view because this is the last
one I was looking at; instead view A is the visible one.

This does indeed sound disorienting: it always activates the first one in
the group.
I've filed a PR for it.  Unfortunately, there is no known workaround.

Do you think the intuitive behaviour is to activate the previously active
view (historical order), or to activate the previous (or next) one in the
shown tab order?

NE (7/30/01 9:49:22 AM)
	VP replies:
Thank you Nick

From my experience, I think the view that should be activated is the
one previously active. The reason is that you might have some other views 
opened, but never used them (you didn't noticed they are opened or just
didn't bother to close them), so activating these views instead of the
ones you really used can be confusing.
In a trace scenario this is very confusing because the order you navigate
the views is very important.

Could you please send me the PR number so I can attach to my defect.

NE (7/30/01 9:51:51 AM)
The point about never seeing views which the user did not explicitly activate is interesting.
It also means that the view's plugin would not be activated unnecessarily, minimizing footprint.

We test the contribution and activation of pages in the view.

Presentation
	Verify that the view shows appropriate scrollbars when its contents extends beyond its client area.

Activation
	If you open a view with properties, verify that the page, the local toolbar and local menu bar in properties view are updated.
		e.g. Open the navigator view and see the change in the properties view.
	If you open another view, its own properties page should appear.
	Switch between two or more components to see page in view change.
	Close one part, activating another, to see page in view change.
	Close last editor to see default blank page in the view.
	Verify that the view shows the default page when the active view doesn't have source.
	Make sure Edit menu in the workbench targets the active page in the view.
	Verify that the enablement and action of the Categories, Filter, and Defaults buttons are consistent with the view's 

		pulldown menu.

Navigator View
	Verify that toggling the Show/Hide-Categories button shows/hides items in the corresponding category tree.
	Verify that the properties view shows correct values in the following fields for a selected resource in the navigator view
		editable, last modified, name, and path
	Verify that only files have values in the size field.

Perisistence
	Verify that on start-up of the view, the view displays properties for the active part and selection of the contributing view.

Property Sheet Example
	Before verifying any of the following tests, do:
		1. Make sure the workbench example is already installed
		2. Create a .usr file and open it 
		3. Show both the outline view and the properties view	

	Verify that the 'Show/Hide Category' toggle button and the 'Restore Default' button work.
	Verify that selecting an item in the outline view shows all properties in the properties view.
	Verify that multiselecting items shows only their common properties.
	Verify that change made to a value for an item is persistent in same session.
	Verify that modifying a value for multiselected items changes the values for all of the selected items.
	Verify that changing the Name value for an item updates the page in the outline view.
	Verify that changing the Name values for multiselected items in the outline view updates the page in the outline view."

Presentation
	Verify that the editor appears when the workbench runs for the first time.
	Verify that the editor shows appropriate scrollbars when its contents extends beyond its client area.
	Verify that if the editor is closed when the workbench closes, the editor remains closed in next session.
	Verify that modifying the editor's entry in the product.ini file updates the workbench by following the steps below.
		1. Make sure the editor is closed when exiting Eclipse.
		2. Open product.ini with a text editor and remove the wecome editor's entry from the file, which is:
			welcomePage = welcome.xml
		3. Restart Eclipse.
		4. Verify that Welcome doesn't show under Help in the workbench pulldown menu.
		5. Exit Eclipse
		6. Add the entry as in step 2 back to product.ini
		7. Resart Eclipse
		8. Verify that Welcome shows again under Help.

Actions
	Verify that Help->Welcome invokes the editor.
	Verify that all links invoke their corresponding actions."

Presentation
	Verify that appropriate strings appear in all menu items and text fields.
	Verify that the view shows appropriate scrollbars when its contents extends beyond its client area.	

View Actions
	Verify that the enablement and the action of Delete and 'Show in Navigator' in the context menu are consistent with the view's tool bar.
	Verify that 'Go to File', Delete, 'Show in Navigator' are enabled only if is there an item selected.
	Verify that 'Go to File', Delete, 'Select All' work.
	Verify that the DELETE key maps to the Delete action.
	Verify that 'Show in Navigator' opens the navigator view, if not already open, and highlights the resouce where the bookmark is.
	Verify that Delete erases the corresponding bookmark marker from the vertical ruler if the file is open in the editor.

Adding bookmarks via Text Editor
	Verify that for a line that doesn't have a bookmark, the context menu in the editor contains 'Add Bookmark...' and invoking it adds both 
		the bookmark marker to the vertical ruler and an item to the view.
	Verify that for a line that has a bookmark, the context menu in the editor contains 'Remove Bookmark' and invoking it removes both
		the bookmark marker from the vertical ruler and the item from the view.

Adding bookmarks via Navigator and Packages views
	Verify that only files have 'Add Bookmark...' in the context menu and invoking it works correctly.

Edit Menu Action
	Verify that the enablement and the actions of Delete, 'Select All', and 'Add Bookmark' in the Edit menu is consistent 
		with the view's context menu.

Persistence
	Verify that the view shows information on open projects only.
	Verify that the view's selection and top index are persistent between sessions."

	In the code, doComputeSize is:

protected Point doComputeSize() {
	if (descriptionLabel != null) {
		Point size = body.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT, true);
		GridData gd = (GridData) descriptionLabel.getLayoutData();
		gd.widthHint = size.x;
	}
	return getControl().computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT, true);
}


It's only called from computeSize() if getControl() is non-null, so the only thing that could be null here is body.
Is it possible for body to be null if descriptionLabel is not null?"

There is still an ""active editor"" (indicated by its tab highlight)

One case I have found is having to hit the editor tab before pressing the

when
I want to do this.

This is a significant problem when using the WSA html editor. They make so many

big hit that it is 
unusable.

items of the
	editor are not removed when a view becomes active. Instead, they 
are ""grayed-out"".
	
RG (8/1/01 9:36:05 AM)
	Why are they deactivated?
	I have to make the editor the active part before using an action.
	I guess the point is that since only editors can contribute to the 
menubar/toolbar and 
	there is the concept of an ""active editor"" even when the editor is not 
the active part, 
	why do we have this modal behavior?
	Are we worried that users will think that the actions relate to an 
active view?

SA (8/1/2001 10:11:57 AM)
	Yeah, there is a couple issues. One problem is with tool items that may 
look
	like they apply to the view. For example, we know the cut/copy/paste 
action
	in the menu bar can be redirected to the view when active. What if an 
editor
	added tool items for cut/copy/paste...how do we redirect these?

	We also built the system on the assumption that the menu and tool bar 
items
	apply to the active part. Maybe because we have this concept of active 
editor
	thought is does not have focus is sufficient for developers to 
understand
	what menu/tool bar items apply to? Be a good candidate for Julien's 
usability
	test.

	What was added is really just a very poor workaround because we commited
	to providing some type of solution."

it would be confusing if half the actions were targetted to the navigator and 
the other half were targetted towards the editor.  

As an alternative, we could say that the window menu ""always"" targets the 
active editor, regardless of the active part.  However, when this approach is 
taken you can't use the standard accelerators for cut, copy, and paste in the 
navigator or any other view.  They are hooked by the active editor.  

It would seem very strange if, with the focus in the navigator, I pressed Del

In Eclipse, I select File | Import | Zip file.  On the dialog for specifying
the zip file, there is a combo box with a Browse button to the right of it.
Unfortunately the combo does not allow me to type the file name into it
(i.e. I'm forced to use the File dialog invoked by the Browse button).  I
often copy/paste the names of files between the desktop and various
programs.  I also sometimes want to pick a previous file and then hand edit
the name to specify a different file in the same directory.  For both of

I want to have a plugin determine whether or not it is licensed to run
during its startup sequence. If it is not licensed to run, the plugin should
have itself removed from the Eclipse plugin registry and all extensions
(e.g., perspectives, views, editors, actions, etc.) should also be removed
(e.g., not visible in the user interface).

I have tried creating a plugin that throws CoreException during its
startup() method and the appropriate message appears in the .metadata/.log
file. However, part of the plugin still appear
to be registered. In the Perspective menu, the plugin's perspective and its
view extensions are still available. However, when one is selected, an error
message is generated as follows:

    An internal error has occurred. Attempt to load class
com.myplugin.PluginLayout
    from deactivated plug-in com.myplugin. See error log for more details.

I have looked at the PDE Guide and examined the IPluginRegistry and
IPluginDescriptor interfaces but there does not appear to be any way to
removing the plugin. Am I missing something? If the plugin cannot be loaded,
it should not appear to be available in the user interface.

TM replies:
The problem here is that the menus are built without your plugin being
activated. Your startup() method is only called when the user tries to actually
select one of the menus or open your perspective. I don't know how to achieve
what you want to do.

KC says:
I should think that failure to load a plugin should cause Eclipse to remove
all contributions from that plugin or to disable them (removing is preferrable). 
Could someone at OTI log a PR against this?

test it out for large files.

Unfortunately, not so fine in Eclipse.  In a project, I imported a

StyledText asks its content for lines as scrolling occurs, so if the line has

chunk, deallocate the current chunk, etc.

The other option is to create a background process which reads chunks of the 
file and appends them to the StyledText content.  This is much like MSWord and 
WordPad handle reading large files.  This option addresses making reading large

	A code example is provided below to reproduce the problem. In the IPerspectiveFactory

	disappears - just like it should.

	The problem seems to be createFolder() adds a real PartTabFolder. However, the RootLayoutContainer

I am using version 0.120 [ne] 01 of org.eclipse.jface.viewers.TableViewer.

The TableViewer is configured with a filter to only allow certain elements
to be displayed.

When I tried to insert an element into the TableViewer using the
insert(Object element , int position) method, I found out that the
position argument is ignored, and the element is always inserted at the
end.

I dug in the code and found out that if the TableViewer has either a
Sorter or a Filter, the insert method calls add(Object) to service the
call (see code fragment below)

public void insert(Object element, int position) {
tableViewerImpl.applyEditorValue();
if (getSorter() != null || hasFilters()) {
add(element);
return;
}
if (position == -1)
position = table.getItemCount();
updateItem(new TableItem(table, SWT.NONE, position), element);
}

As you can see, if the TableViewer has any filters, it calls add(Object),
but does not pass the position argument along.  Internally, add(Object)
calls indexForElement(Object), but without a Sorter it always returns the
position at the end of the table.

Does it mean that if one uses a filter, one must supply a sorter at the
same time?

I thought about it a little bit and this makes sense to a certain degree. 
The semantics of the position is ambiguous.  It can mean the position of
the added element in either the filtered list or un-filtered list. 
However, simply ignoring the position argument and relegating the element
to the end of the list seems to be the worst of both worlds.

Thanks in advance.

NOTES:

Yes, this is a bug, for which I've filed a PR.

The spec states that the position is relative to the model.  As you point
out, however, it can't figure out the correct position in the widget if
items have been filtered out.  The only way it could figure it out would be
for the viewer to hang onto the original, pre-filtered list from the model,
but it does not do this: it gets the list from the model, optionally filters
and sorts it, then stuffs the corresponding labels into the underlying table
widget.  So about the best it could do currently is to do a full refresh of
the list.

As a workaround for this bug, you could do a refresh() on the table viewer
yourself.  Note that this is an O(N) operation, though.  So if you're
inserting many items, it would be better to just modify your model, then
issue a single refresh() after all insertions are done.

NE (8/2/01 9:56:27 AM)
WHH posts:

great to hear that you have filed a PR about this problem.

Your work-around is fine and it works.  However, for people using MOF2,
another work-around is necessary because the insert and update calls are
generate automatically and the developer does not have easy control over
them.  I am working around this problem in another way, and I want to
share it here with other people.

The work-around is to add a sorter which sorts the elements in the model
order.  Since a sorter is available, the indexOfElement method actually
returns a meaningful result and enables the element to be inserted
correctly.

Using a sorter sounds like a bad performance choice.  However, I don't
think that a full sort was performed during the insert.  The method
indexOfElement just uses the sorter to perform a binary search of the
proper index to search for the element, which is an O(log(N)) operation.

The statements above are the results of very casual thoughts and may be
incorrect.  I am sharing this as a possible alternative.  If something is
wrong please correct me."

- I think there already is a dialog that pops up if no pages exist, we just never
see it because the action would be disabled if that were the case.
- If we do pop up a dialog, would it be more polite to display the properties dialog
with no pages available but display a dummy page that reads 'No properties
available' in the title; this may be better justification for ignoring the check
and always enabling the action.
- Don't all Navigator items have at least the Info page?  The only items that will
appear in the Nav are Projects, Folders, and Files which all have the Info page.

Hi,

Not sure if this has come up before, but it appears that the Outline View
of the Java perspective - i.e. the one which displays methods and fields
for a class or interface - does not allow a plugin to add menu items. I
have tried all I know to add items into this view but without success, and
looking at the source code it does not appear that the JavaOutlineView
code permits another plugin to insert menu items.

Is this a bug - or am I just not getting the plugin.xml entries correct?
(I am able to modify the Packages View popup menu, so I don't think I am
doing anything wrong. If it is supposed to work please can someone append
an example here.

Thanks,


NOTES:

NE (8/1/01 3:00:59 PM)
You have run into a limitation of the current design.
Normally, views which want to allow other plugins to contribute to their
context menu must register it using
IWorkbenchPartSite.registerContextMenu(...).
Unfortunately, pages which are contributed to the Outline view are not given
access to the IWorkbenchPartSite, or any other API for registering a context
menu.

Note that the Outline view is a generic view of the Eclipse UI.  JDT
contributes its outline page to it, but it has no way of registering its
context menu.  So this is a limitation of Eclipse UI, not JDT.

This is a known problem, which we are considering how best to fix.

NE (8/2/01 3:44:01 PM)
MW adds:
From a plugin developer's POV, I would think this is important - not being
able to modify the menu in the outline view prevents plugin developers
from easily giving a way for users to access plugin functionality on the
selection of an item in that window (i.e. for Java, I would like to
augment the pop-up menu for a field or method)."

You can move between views using tab or shift-tab and get to the editor area to activate the

the editor text) but you can not scroll through the editors.  You can even use the keyboard to
switch perspectives (alt-up/alt-down).

We can add alt-left/alt-right to scroll through the editors.  I have been using these shortcuts
myself for a while and I find it very useful (especially going back and forth between two
editors).  We can also add alt-Enter for zooming on the editor/view.

Some views need to track a specific part, which is not necessarily active.
For example, the debug perspective's variables, console and other views typically track the selection
in the debug/launches view.

Currently, they have to write their own selection-service-like support for doing this:
	- tracking creation/disposal of the target view (not activation)
	- hooking a listener when created (and removing it when disposed)

An API like the following would allow a part to simply track the selection in a specific other part:

	/**
	 * Adds a selection listener which is notified when selection changes in any workbench part 
	 * whose id is in the given array.  This is independent of part activation: the part need not
	 * be active for notification to be sent.  The listener is also notified when the part is created
	 * and disposed.  When the part is created, the listener is passed the part's initial selection.
	 * When the part is disposed, the listener is passed an empty selection.
	 *
	 * @param partIds an array of workbench part identifiers 
	 * @param listener the listener to be notified

Here's an unexpected result:

I have added several popup menu items to a couple of Java views - but not
the Outline view :-( - and was expecting that when my correponding plugin
run(IAction) method was called that the action.getId() method call would
return the id matching the popup menu item just selected. The thought was
that I could use that id for selecting the correct action to take.

Instead all I get is a generic id (e.g. ""PluginAction.8"") which is of no
use to me since I have no way of knowing what that id means.

I have worked around the problem by using the setInitializationData method
which returns the correct id, however I would have naturally expected the
same id to be returned in the IAction object.

Bug?

	At some point during the development of the sorting algorithm for action delegates there was a
reason to use a unique id.  However, I can't remember what it is now and there is no
clue from the code.  This was a very rushed last minute change.  

	To test the proposed change I added the following line to the constructor for ActionDescriptor 
and found the behavior seemed OK ..  We should probably try the fix and test in house.

public ActionDescriptor(IConfigurationElement actionElement, int targetType, Object target) {
	// Load attributes.
	id = actionElement.getAttribute(ATT_ID);
	...

	// Create action.
	action = createAction(targetType, actionElement, target);

3. Move the mouse pointer down into the editing part of the editor

		Verify icons for files in the file listbox.
	[Enablement]
		The Back button is enabled and the Next button is greyed out all the time.
		Both of the Browse buttons are enabled.
		The 'Select Types', 'Select All', and 'Deselect All' buttons are enabled only if there is at least one item in the folder tree.
		Finish is enabled only if there is one or more resources selected and the destination folder is not empty.
	[Selection Action]		
		Verify that 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' work.
		Selecting a folder resource shows all files it has in the file listbox.
		Checking a folder resource checks all of its subfolders and its files, and always grey-checks its ancestor folders.
		Unchecking a folder unchecks files and subfolders underneath it. It unchecks its ancestor folder recursively if 
			it is last resource checked. Otherwise, it grey-checks its ancestor recursively.
		Checking a file always grey-checks the folder it is in.
		Unchecking a file unchecks its ancestor folder recursively if it is last file selected. Otherwise, it grey-checks its ancestor recursively.
	[Select Types Dialog]
		Verify that the 'Other Extensions' text box shows only those user-defined file types that are not in the list.
		e.g. 
			- type in *.java and click OK
			- open the dialog again and ensure that the .java check box is checked and the textbox does NOT have .java in it.
			- in the dialog, type in *.eclipse and click OK
			- open the dialog again and ensure that the textbox has .eclipse in it.
		Verify that the filter selects files by both checked file types and specified types among the selected resources only.
		Verify that invoking the filter updates appropriate checkboxes of files and folders.
		Verify that invoking the filter by one type and then immediately by a different type leaves all resources unchecked.
	[Destination Folder Selection Dialog]
		Go-into is enabled only if the selected folder has a subfolder.
		If the root of the tree widget is the same as the root of the workspace, Home is enabled and Back is not.
		If the root of the tree widget is NOT the same as the root of the workspace, Home is disabled and Back is enabled.
		Verify that Home, Back, and Go-Into work.
		Selecting a folder shows its complete path in the text box.
		Clicking on OK in the dialog updates the contents of the Folder textbox in the wizard.
	[Options]
		The setting for common options are shared by pages.
		If the Overwrite checkbox is unchecked, importing a resource to the same destination twice pops up the Confirm Overwrite dialog.
		If the Overwrite checkbox is checked, you can import a resource to the same destination twice without confirming it.
	[Navigator View]
		Verify that the navigator view is updated after importing.
	[Persistence]
		Verify that the five most recent sources stored in the source combo listbox are persistent between sessions.
		Verify that the settings of the options are persistent between sessions.

File System Page
	Selecting a source directory shows its folder structure using itself as the root in the left tree.
	Verify that all of the selected resources are imported successfully.	
	If the 'Complete folder structure' checkbox is unchecked, importing a resource creates a folder structure relative 
		to the root of the tree widget in the destination folder.
	If the 'Complete folder structure' checkbox is checked, importing a resource creates a folder structure using the 
		source's absolute path in the destination folder.

I am trying to create a cascading menu under my own menu.

MyMenu
Menu1->Submenu1
       Submenu2


I cannot get this to work.

I can, using the same technique as outlined in the help,  add the submenu
to the Window menu, and it works. 

Window
Menu1->Submenu1
       Submenu2

But when I try to add the submenu to my menu, the menu shows up but it is
grayed and none of the Submenu items are available. 

MyMenu
Menu1 (grayed)

The log reports
1 org.eclipse.core.resources 4 Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid):
SubMenu1Id

Here is the sample I based the code on. This is from the Eclipse
documentation.

Here is a version that I got to work in my own application.

<actionSet

   <menu

   </menu>
   <menu id=""Menu1Id""
    label = ""&Menu1""
    path =""window/additions"">
    <separator name=""slot1"" />
    <separator name=""slot2"" />
    <separator name=""slot3"" />
   </menu>
   <action

    menubarPath = ""window/Menu1Id/slot1""
    label = ""&SubMenu1""
    class = ""com.rational.test.ft.wswplugin.x"">
   </action>


Here is a version that fails in my application. The only difference is
that instead of window, I use MyMenu and instead of additions, I use
MyMenu1Slot. I tried variations on ids and slots, but nothing changed.

<actionSet
   id=""com.rational.test.ft.wswplugin.TestActionSet""

   </action>


NOTES:

NE (8/7/01 5:25:18 PM)	
	Reproduced both success case and fail case.
	Problem is that the call to parent.findMenuUsingPath(mpath) in 
PlugActionSetBuilder.contributeMenuAction()
	returns null when mpath has multiple segments.
	This is because SubMenuManager.findUsingPath calls findUsingPath on the 
parentMgr,
	and MenuManager.findUsingPath tests whether the parent menu is an 
IMenuManager,
	which it is not in this case.  It was wrapped in an 
ActionSetContributionItem (subclass of SubContributionItem).
	Should change SubMenuManager.findUsingPath to recurse itself, 
unwrapping at each stage.

NE (08/07/01 6:01:14 PM)
	Suggested fix:

Change SubContributionManager.find() to unwrap (it doesn't currently, but 
should):
public IContributionItem find(String id) {
	IContributionItem item = parentMgr.find(id);
	if (item instanceof SubContributionItem) {
		return ((SubContributionItem)item).getInnerItem();
	} else {
		return item;
	}
}

Change SubMenuManager.getWrapper(IMenuManager) to always create wrapper (as 
spec'ed).
Also added @param tag:

/**
 * Returns the menu wrapper for a menu manager.
 * <p>
 * The sub menus within this menu are wrapped within a 
<code>SubMenuManager</code> to
 * monitor additions and removals.  If the visibility of this menu is modified
 * the visibility of the sub menus is also modified.
 * <p>
 *
 * @param menu the menu manager to wrap
 * @return the menu wrapper
 */
private IMenuManager getWrapper(IMenuManager menu) {
	if (mapMenuToWrapper == null) {
		mapMenuToWrapper = new HashMap(4);
	}
	SubMenuManager wrapper = (SubMenuManager) mapMenuToWrapper.get(menu);
	if (wrapper == null) {
		wrapper = wrapMenu(menu);
		mapMenuToWrapper.put(menu, wrapper);
	}
	return wrapper;
}

Change SubMenuManager.findMenuUsingPath to just call getWrapper() rather than 
getWrapper then putWrapper if null:
public IMenuManager findMenuUsingPath(String path) {
	IContributionItem item = findUsingPath(path);
	if (item instanceof IMenuManager) {
		IMenuManager menu = (IMenuManager)item;
		return getWrapper(menu);
	}
	return null;
}

Change SubMenuManager.findUsingPath to use same algorithm as 
MenuManager.findUsingPath, but wrapping
submenus along the way:
public IContributionItem findUsingPath(String path) {
	String id = path;
	String rest = null;
	int separator = path.indexOf('/');
	if (separator != -1) {
		id = path.substring(0, separator);
		rest = path.substring(separator + 1);
	}
	IContributionItem item = find(id); // unwraps item
	if (rest != null && item instanceof IMenuManager) {
		IMenuManager menu = (IMenuManager) item;
		// wrap menu, just like findMenuUsingPath
		IMenuManager wrapper = getWrapper(menu);
		return wrapper.findUsingPath(rest);
	}
	return item;
}

Delete SubMenuManager.putWrapper -- it's no longer needed."
2682,unknown63@eclipse.org,2001-10-15T16:30:12Z,1,0,"This is fixed.  Changes were made to SubContributionManager, SubMenuManager, 
and ActionSetMenuManager.

2nd, third and fourth are for a problem reported by a customer (can't find pr),

Note: I applied all of NEs changes except for one change in findUsingPath. 
In this code he will wrap any submenu which we drill into.  I decided not to do 
this.  There is no reason to wrap a menu unless the user adds a contribution to 
it.  We assume this is only the case when findMenuUsingPath is called, and do 
the wrapping there.  Thus, the SubMenuManager only wraps those subs which are 
modified.

Common Properties for All Pages
	Verify that all listboxes show appropriate scrollbars when their contents extends beyond their client area.
	The Cancel button is enabled all the time.
	Verify that Cancel discards all changes made to the wizard by doing the following:
		- on the Select page, choose any one of items in the list and click Next.
		- make change to the destination or the option settings or both.
		- cancel the wizard.
		- open the wizard again and ensure that the preselection of the Select page( if there was any ), and the values of 
			the destination and the options remain the same as before the change.

Select Page( first page )
	The Next button is enabled only if there is selection in the list.
	Verify that the destination from the most recent export, regardless of session, is preselected in the listbox.
	Verify icons for items in the list.

Common Properties for the File System Page and the Zip File Page( second page )
* Please run this test separately for each of the pages.
	[Presentation]
		The folder tree shows open projects only.
		Verify icons for files in the file listbox.
	[Enablement]
		The Back and Browse button are enabled and the Next button is disabled all the time.
		Finish is disabled if the destination folder is empty.
		If nothing is selected when Finish is pressed a warning dialog appears.
		The 'Select Types', 'Select All', and 'Deselect All' buttons are always enabled.
	[Selection Action]
		Verify that 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' work.
		Selecting a folder resource shows all files it has in the file listbox.
		Checking a folder resource checks all of its subfolders and its files, and always grey-checks its ancestor folders.
		Unchecking a folder unchecks files and subfolders underneath it. It unchecks its ancestor folder recursively 
			if it is last resource checked. Otherwise, it grey-checks its ancestor recursively.
		Checking a file always grey-checks the folder it is in.
		Unchecking a file unchecks its ancestor folder recursively if it is last resource selected. 
			Otherwise, it grey-checks its ancestor recursively.
	[Select Types Dialog]
		Verify that the 'Other Extensions' text box shows only those user-defined file types that are not in the list.
			e.g. 
			- type in *.java and click OK
			- open the dialog again and ensure that the .java check box is checked and the textbox does NOT have .java in it.
			- in the dialog, type in *.eclipse and click OK
			- open the dialog again and ensure that the textbox has .eclipse in it.
		The filter selects files by both checked file types and specified types from entire resources.
		Invoking the filter updates appropriate checkboxes of files and folders.
	[Destination]
		The destination combo listbox is preselected with the most recent destination to which the user exported.
		The destination combo listbox in the wizard stores the five most recent destinations to which resources were exported.
	[Options]
		The setting for common options are shared by pages.
		If the Overwrite checkbox is unchecked, exporting a resource to the same destination twice pops up the Confirm Overwrite dialog.
		If the Overwrite checkbox is checked, exporting a resource to the same destination twice does not invoke confirmation.
	[Persistence]
		Verify that the five most recent destinations stored in the destination listbox are persistent between sessions.
		Verify that the settings of the options are persistent between sessions.
	[Navigator View]
		If the wizard is invoked while there is a resource(s) selected in the navigator view, those resource(s) are checked in the folder tree.

File System Page
	[Export]
		Verify that all files are exported successfully to the specified destination.
		If the 'Create directory structure' checkbox is unchecked, exporting creates a directory structure that roots from the root 
			of the folder tree within the destination directory.
		If the 'Create directory structure' checkbox is checked, exporting creates the same directory structure as the workspace 
			within the destination directory.
	[Browse for Folder Dialog]
		The destination textbox of the dialog is preselected with the current destination folder from the dialog.
		Specifying the destination in the dialog and then clicking OK updates the destination textbox of the wizard. Otherwise, the wizard
			is not updated.

Zip File Page
	Verify that a .zip file is exported successfully to the specified destination.	
	Use an external ZIP program to verify the following:
		- the ZIP file is extracted successfully by the ZIP program.
		- the ZIP file made with the 'Create directory structure' checkbox turned on has the same directory structure as the workspace."

Filtered TableViewer ignores index on insert()

I can understand where the index is ignored on insert() if the
TableViewer has a sorter, but if the TableViewer has a filter,
and the element passed into insert() survives that filter, the
position parameter should be respected instead of ignored.

Currently, if the TableViewer has a sorter or a filter, the
position parameter is ignored, and the element is added to
the end of the table.

In testing on the 20010724-0100 R09 Packaged JDK build,
I opened a JSP file and saw the Page Designer icon in the
file tab, but didn't see the Design, Source, and Preview pages.
I finally realized that I was in the Default Text Editor.
So, if you open an HTML/JSP/XML ... file in the Default Text
Editor, you should see the same icon that you see on the
Open With->Default Text Editor selection in the file tab
(not the Page Designer or the XML Editor icons).

If this is an OTI defect, please update the component.

In testing on the 20010724-0100 R09 Packaged JDK build,
I double-clicked on the system icon in the upperleft corner
of the Workbench.  This caused a Saving Problems dialog
to appear with the following text: ""Unable to store workbench state.""

HERE'S THE STEPS I DID AT THE TIME (NOTE: I can't confirm if this
is reproducible since my workbench appears to still be messed up
even after restarting it):
1. I had a JSP file open (I don't know if I opened it or if it was open 
    upon restarting the Workbench ... I think the latter case applied, though)
1. created the Your Company web example
2. opened the index.html file that is directly under webApplication
    NOTE: the Design page was the open page when I did this
    NOTE: this is a frame file.  I wanted to try it with a non-frame file, but 
               as I noted, my workbench is messed up at this point
3. make a change to the file
4. double-click on the system icon in the upper left of the Workbench
    Saving Problems dialog appears as noted.
    NOTE: The standard out showed that 4 problems occurred in saving the workbench.
5. select OK on Saving Problems dialog
6. Save Resources prompt appears
7. select the No button
    The Workbench disappears, but a 
    Problems saving workspace dialog appears with the following text:
    ""Problems occurred while trying to save the state of the workbench.""
8. select Details
    See ""Could not write metadata for /.""
9. select OK
10. restart the Workbench
11. Error dialog appears with the following text:
      ""Unable to read workbench state. workbench.xml will be deleted.""
12. select OK
      Workbench appears, but only J2EE perspective appears
      (lost any perspectives had previously opened)
13. opened the Web Perspective to verify projects and files were still there!
14. repeated step 4 and Saving problems dialog appeared again as before!

After this, I used the Web Example and Web Project wizards and neither of
them would close after selecting the Finish button and I noticed both projects
did not contain an ibm-web-ext.xmi file under WEB-INF (should they or does this
file get generated later?).  I then tried the HTML File wizard and it closed
after selecting Finish.

Since I assume this is related to having a frame file open when I closed the
workbench, I opened this defect against wsa.web.pageediting.  If this problem
is not related to PageEditing, please reroute this defect to the appropriate
component.

Asahata-san,
It seems that a config file of workbench is broken.
We cannot see that data from Yamato, so please contact Kathy-san, and take a look at the problem.
Thank you.

    <Note by wakao (Wakao, Masaki), 2001/07/27 08:07:15, seq: 3 rel: 0  action: note>
We think this is a Eclipse Workbench problem.

Maybe the following file has been corrupted.

workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui/workbench.xml 


Endres-san, 
Could you try to rename the file to another name and do the same scenario.
If the problem is gone, this defect should be rerouted to was.prereq.workbench component.

George said he suspected the problem was that I was out of space.
I looked and the drive I installed the build on had a free space of 0.
So, I'm bumping the severity of this from a 1 to 3.

I recommend this be opened as an OTI defect to output a more
explicit message.

In this case we return a ResourceException that contains a status object:

status message: Could not write metadata for /.
status exception: IOException
IOException message: (varies by VM, but this is the most explicit message you'll 
ever get.  On IBM JRE it says something like, ""Could not write <filename>.  Not 
enough space on disk"".

The problem is, the JFace ErrorDialog only shows the status messages in the 
details area, not the status' exception's message.  If it showed both we would 
get a clearer message in most cases. I suggest making this fix in 
ErrorDialog.populateList(...).  Note that it should check for both null 
exceptions and null exception messages, some exceptions don't have a message.

I will change ""Could not write metadata for /."" to ""Could not write metadata for

In Navigator hold Ctrl key and click to select many files can result in creating many copies. 

Scenario: 
Had many html files that I wanted to delete. 
Started on the bottom and held down the CTRL key and started
clicking starting at the bottom.  I was clicking/selecting rapidly when noticed that
all the files were being Copied.  Resulted in copying all that I was selecting to delete and opened several as well.

When more perspectives are opened than whose icon can physically
be stacked on the left edge of the application, a scrollable
widget of some sort should be added to the bottom of the perspective
icon stack to allow me to scroll down to the newly opened
perspectives.  Yes - I understand that you need to open many (over ~20)
perspectives to consume the physical space, but since it is
allowed, the GUI should better handle it.

One of the changes we are going to need to make is to start using the SWT 
coolbar control (required to look like a good XP application). Check with the 
SWT team to see if we can make the switch now. 

The Coolbar control should allow for scrolling and rearranging items. It may be 
possible to use this control to show the fastview icons as well. "

a drop down menu for items that are not visible.

That aside, currently the SWT CoolBar is horizontal only.  I'm not sure if that 
is because the platform widget can only be vertical or if that aspect of the 
CoolBar has not been implemented.

If true scrolling of the toolbar is wanted, some kind of scrollable viewport 
widget should be used.  Reassigning to KH for comment."

Also: RBS_VERTICALGRIPPER    Version 4.71. The size grip will be displayed 
vertically instead of horizontally in a vertical rebar control. This style is 
ignored for rebar controls that do not have the CCS_VERT style.

Have *not* tried setting the bits, so not sure how many isseus exist. We were 
careful to give our height/width related API names like ""setSize(Point)"", 
""SetPreferredSize(Point)"", ""setMinimumSize(Point)""... so just in case we go

A little bit more than this would be great. This code returns all children of the visible and expanded elements, even the children that are not visible.

- create a .txt file
- open it in both perspectives
- modify and close it in one
- there is no prompt to save
- close it in the other
- it prompts

This seems reasonable on the surface, but can actually be quite confusing.

The expectation is that if I close an editor with unsaved changes, it prompts me.
People often use this as a shortcut for hitting save: they expect to get prompted.

This is especially confusing if the other perspective has its editors hidden.
If so, you don't find out about the unsaved changes until you try and exit.

While document sharing should work across perspectives, it should still prompt to save
when closing an editor with unsaved changes.
Also when closing the perspective or window containing it.

On Windows it holds about 160 characters of text, but on Linux this is

truncated on Linux.  

The truncation on Linux looks worse than it does 
on Windows also because on Linux it spills to 3 lines and centres the
lines vertically, thus losing the top half of line 1 and the bottom half
of line 3.  On Windows it truncates by simply not showing line 3.

Can a font be chosen that more consistently matches the size/style of

I usually go and modify the class path to use a subfolder with the original project name,
so the default output folder isn't acceptable.

It gives me a warning in the title of the property page, but its background is gray.
The text is also often truncated due to the length of the names.
So it's easy to miss when staring at the OK button and wondering why it's disabled.

If you do find the message, it's not obvious how to go about fixing it (especially since it's truncated):
you have to append /bin to the output folder field.

It really took me a while the first time to figure this out, even though I know wizards and dialogs
report errors at the top.

This is probably a general issue with how we report errors in preference and property pages,
so feel free to move down after your consideration.

NOTES:

NE (08/13/01 6:47:13 PM)
	The error message if you try to select a different property page is also not very informative:
		""The currently displayed page contains invalid values""
	Which value?  How can I fix it?

MA (14.08.2001 16:32:43)
	The message ""The currently displayed page contains invalid values"" comes from the desktop when the user
	tries to switch to another page while the current page has not set valid.
	To be more informative, the error dialog could also contain the current error message.

	The truncation of error messages in property and preference pages can not be solved by property pages implementors;
	the desktop should wrap the error messages. Suggest to move PR to desktop

2723,Kevin_Haaland@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T02:42:14Z,0,0,"API is availble for a wizard page to specify the default button:
( (Wizard)getWizard() ).getShell().setDefaultButton(button);

Authors of wizards may wish to specify a default button other than next/finish when they
are both disabled.  This can be done easily on an event that occurs on the page, but the
initial default button (the button that will be the default when the page appears)
cannot be set.  The only signal the wizard page recieves that it becomes visible is
setVisble(boolean), but the wizard dialog will update the button bar after the setVisible call:

WizardDialog::showPage():
	currentPage.setVisible(true);
	oldPage.setVisible(false);

	// update the dialog controls
	update();

We have an inconsistency here that we should fix.

Currently:
(1) you can set the Default Button on a page event, even if Finish/Next are enabled
	(page is complete).
(2) you cannot set the inital Default Button

We should change this behaviour to:
(3) you can only set the Default button if the page is incomplete
(4) you can set the initial default button if the page is incomplete

-OR-
(5) do not allow the wizardPage to set the default button.

#4 is an easy fix, the old behaviour would set Finish as default if both Next/Finish were disabled,
this version won't change the default if both Finish/Next are disabled.
WizardDialog::updateButtons():
	if (canFinish)
		getShell().setDefaultButton(finishButton);
	else if (canFlipToNextPage)
		getShell().setDefaultButton(nextButton);

#3 and #5 would be hard to regulate, because it would require cutting off access to the
wizard shell.

A safe way to do #3 would be to add API to WizardDialog: setDefaultButton(Button).  This would
set the default button only if next AND finish are disabled which would provide a safe means
to set the default button.

		The workbench would have to provide extension points to plugin custom filters into the

	The field editor should not remain active when it loses focus; it should accept the changes.

Headline:   Unable to change the label of the Delete menu 

Description:
The label of Delete menu needs to be changed.

In Eclipse, this requires the global Delete action to be a LabelRetargetAction (instead of
RetargetAction in R0.9).


NOTES:

[CL (8/27/01 9:32:52 AM)] In Rose, there are two types of Delete commands that can be 
	performed on a diagram -- Delete from Model and Delete from Diagram.  We want to be able to 
	rename Delete to be one of them, and add the other one ourselves.

GDA(8/27/01 9:32:49 AM)> Why not just use delete for delete in diagram since this is likely what a user would expect when they are working in the diagram.
This is unlikely to be visited before 1.0 so the alternative probably makes sense."

	I was setting the input of a tableviewer two times with the same input.
	The first time, mapElement was called for each element, the second time for none of them.
	
	'setInput()' always unmaps all elements. So after the second setInput the map is empty.

	I think this is the problematic code: (StructuredViewer)

	protected void associate(Object element, Item item) {
		Object data = item.getData();
		if (data == element)
			return;											<< returns without mapElement
		if (data != null)
			disassociate(item);
		item.setData(element);
		mapElement(element, item);

		1. Open the package viewer, create java project proj, package 'pack' and CU 'A.java'
		2. set breakpoints on mapElement and unmapElement
		3. create a cu pack.B.java
 		4. Even A.java stays the same, is is mappes and unmapped several times.

It would be better if disassociate does not check 'elementMap' to be non-null.

places as well, e.g. findItem.

"
2741,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2001-12-21T19:59:46Z,6,0,"Regarding the original bug re unmapAllElements(), it would be nice to avoid 
having to do extra work in associate to cover for the case where there is an 
item->element mapping but not an element->item mapping.

The simplest approach would be to simply null out the data fields of the items 
when the map is cleared, in unmapAllElements().
Unfortunately, this won't work since disassociate() asserts that the data is 
not null (and I'd like to leave this assert in).  It also makes unmapAllElements
() inconsistent with unmapElement(), which does not do this.

Another approach is to remove all items in TableViewer.inputChanged, so that 
there is no inconsistency.  However, this is expensive.  It is much more costly 
to delete and re-add table items than just updating their labels.
This would be a big hit for large tables (e.g. the task list).

The best approach would be to remove the call to unmapElements() from setInput
() and only do it in the inputChanged method of subclasses where it makes sense 
(it does for tree viewers, but not for TableViewer).
Unfortunately, we can't do this since this would be a breaking API change.

So for now, I will change associate to always do a mapElement.
The cost is an extra table lookup (when the element map is enabled), which is 
much cheaper than item creation/deletion.

I will also make the change to unmapElement proposed in the previous comment, 
which will let you simply override mapElement(Object, Item) and unmapElement
(Object, Item) (override this one rather than unmapElement(Object)).
Note that you'll likely get more mapElement calls than unmapElement calls due 
to the change to associate.

Could you try out the following changes to StructuredViewer?  Although the 
tests pass, and Eclipse runs, I am reluctant to release them just before going 
away for the holidays.

I am using a TreeViewer to build my Outline View Trees and I noticed that
if I call refresh() it makes the tree flicker.  
There are some times when I need to call refresh() because I have cases
where I do multiple updates to my tree model and it is just easier to call
refresh()then figure out what has changed (besides refresh() is recursive,
which is exactly what I would have to do to see what has been modified).

In either case I will try to bore you with the details but after I call
refresh() the entire tree flickers and I think it is because
internalRefresh(Widget,Object,boolean) calls
updateItem((Item)widget,element) which calls ... which calls
doUpdateItem(Item item, Object element) for every node.  This is ok but it
calls this method even if Item has not changed.

I tried some things and it seems like the following fixed my problem


There is one more check but why do the update if the Text or the Image has
not changed?  I am assuming as soon as I call item.setText(text) the tree
knows that it has to update this.

Does anyone see any side effects with this?

Dave,

Thanks for the suggestion.  We actually had similar checks in TableViewer at
one point, but took them out because getting the text and image were a
noticeable performance hit.  In most of our cases, the flicker wasn't too
bad.  It may be worse for trees though.
It may be possible to push this comparison down into SWT, and minimize the
performance hit.  I'll discuss it with the SWT team.

The refresh updates all items because that's how refresh is spec'ed.  The
labels may have changed, even if the same elements are there.
It would be nice to have a flag indicating whether labels should be updated
for existing elements.
We are considering adding this for 2.0."

Hi,

How can we filter multiple file extensions in popupMenus?
For example,
..
.
<extension point=""org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus"">
<objectContribution
   id=""com.ibm.voicetools.grammar.menu""
           objectClass=""org.eclipse.core.resources.IFile""
           nameFilter=""*.1 , *.2"">
        <action
          id=""com.ibm.testtool""
          label=""%popupMenus.label""
..
.

I've already tried "" *.1 *.2"" and ""*.1;*.2"". It doesn't seem to work.
Note: I'm using R09 version of Eclipse.

NOTES:

NE (8/22/01 10:50:43 AM)
Unfortunately the nameFilter does not currently support OR-style combination of patterns.
I've filed a problem report for this.

As a workaround, you could define separate objectContribution's for *.1 and *.2.
The spec for nameFilter says that the contribution will not appear if the pattern does not match, 
so the action should show up at most once."

	This is triggered/caused by: 1GIRYZE: ITPJUI:WINNT - JAR export wizard: ""AssertionFailedException: null argument""
	which will be fixed in 0.133 and hence no immediate action is required for the Wizard.

	The problem is that the Wizard stays open after the error and then displays
	the JarPackageWizardPage when the user clicked on ""Zip file"" (or ""File system).

	The Wizard should either recover if one component fails or shut itself down.

	When the user closes the dialog and then selects ""Export... --> Zip file"" then correct
	page comes up and it works.

	Moving to ITPUI.

I had a group of html files in a project to export.  Some of the files
were configured to use the default text editor.  Others were configured to
use an external editor (a GUI vi clone called gvim).  The ones that were
configured to use gvim failed to export.  The ones configured to use the
default editor suceeded.  Upon changing all file to use the Workbench text
editor by default, the export of all files succeeded.

Also, the ""Details"" button of the error panel told me which files failed
to export, but not the reason why.

I am using ""jre-win32-Eclipse-SDK-SHIPPED-0.128.zip"".

NOTES:

NE (8/22/01 11:35:21 AM)
This is probably due to the workspace being out of synch with the filesystem.
Before you export, try choosing ""Refresh From Local"" in the Navigator's popup menu 
with the project selected.
I've filed a problem report for this, since there doesn't seem to be any reason why you 
shouldn't be able to export even if it's out of sync.
Also, as you point out, the error reporting could use some improvement.

EJP (10/3/2001 4:46:13 PM)
	Suggestion: The catch block in the exportFile (zip and etc) could create a MultiStatus instead.
	So the user would know why it failed to export.

	} catch (CoreException e) {
		MultiStatus status = new MultiStatus(
				PlatformUI.PLUGIN_ID,
				0,
				DataTransferMessages.format(
					""DataTransfer.errorExporting"", //$NON-NLS-1$
					new Object[] { fullPath }),
				e);
		status.add(e.getStatus());
		errorTable.add(status);

	Here is a reply from Ted Stockwell (8/27/2001 10:19AM)

	How about being able to define ""hidden"" view, editor, perspective, and
	wizard categories?
	To do this a new attribute named ""hidden"" could be added to the associated
	category element tags.
	Defining hidden = ""true"" would be a hint to not include the categories in UI
	elements that display them, so the categories won't show up in menus,
	toolbars and such.
	Everything else about the objects in these hidden categories would remain
	the same.

DS (8/28/01 11:13:00 AM)
	The hidden attribute is an interesting idea.  It still forces the ISV to declare their view up front
	but the view does not appear in the menus.  The same tag could be added for editors, like the
	compare, which are not normally be visible."

	Besides the request to create view parts programmatically I would also 
like
	to see this for menus and tool bar buttons too. The background is as 
follows:

	- stuff contributed by xml is very limited regarding disabling/enabling.
	- sometime actions make only sense in the UI if the corresponding 
plugin is
	loaded.

	Given this I see two ways to contribute something to the workbench:

	- via xml. This means we have limited access to the UI resources but 
the are
	present in the UI without loading any plugin code.
	- via code. Here we have full control over the UI resource. (For 
example,
	you can enable/disable a toolbar button using code).
   These UI resources only show up if the plugin is loaded. They are
	contributed by the plugin class itself.


NOTES:

DS (8/28/01 11:14:24 AM)
	 EJP is currently working on a feature to restart plugins which
	have an active action contribution.  Is this any different than loading 
a plugin early once
	the user has selected it for use in their environment.  Perhaps the 
idea of extension declaration
	is too weak at the UI level and we should just let the user select a 
bunch of plugins which
	load eagerly, and these plugins may contribute directly 
through ""contributor"" extensions."

This looks ugly because it is in the content outline view, and the extra border
is not necessary.  For example, compare the readme example content outline
(which uses the default viewer) to the java content outline (which creates its own widgets),
and you'll see that the ugly border in the readme outline stands out.

Simple fix: create the viewer without a border by default.
Fancy fix: put the viewer creation in a protected method so subclasses can override it.

Looks like the control keys don't work in the Navigator. The interesting
part is that they seem to work if the Navigator view is un-docked and
free-floating.

Anyone know whats going on here?

For example,

Right-click on item in the Navigator, choose rename.
Change the name.
Press control-Z to undo. Nothing happens

Now undock the Navigator and try scenario again. It works!


NOTES:

NE (8/31/01 12:12:56 PM)
When docked, the control-keys are probably being stolen by the accelerators in the edit menu (or other menus), 
which are directed to the current view (the navigator in this case), not the edit field for the rename.
When undocked, these aren't there, so the key goes to the edit field.
Thanks for pointing out the distinction.

Why are all of the Toolbar Buttons converted to black & white?  From a users
point of view, this makes no sense, since gray typically indicates disabled.
For some icons, the B&W form is identical to its disabled form.  The black
and white toolbar is drab.  Not to mention it wastes Image handles and the
ImageCache leaks memory in ActionContributionItem.

NE (08/30/01 5:41:39 PM)
	I was running the site example.
	The workspace was apparently saved OK.

DS (9/13/01 12:55:46 PM)
	At the time this PR was filed Veronika says that SWT included version 1.2 of
	BusyIndicator.  
	Here is the source.  Line 99 is indicated by the arrow.

static void clear(Display display) {
	int index = 0;
	while (index < displays.length) {
		if (displays[index] == display) break;    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
		index++;
	}

	There is a contradiction here.  The stack trace indicates a problem in busyWhile, but line
	99 is in the clear method.  This method will only be called after the display is disposed.
	Display disposal happens in the Workbench.run method after everything else.

	Perhaps Nick had modified the code in some way.  I will confer.

NE (9/17/01 12:35:04 PM)
	No, I had no changes to SWT in my workspace.
	If I open BusyIndicator.java in my build 133 self-hosting workspace, line 99 is:
	try {
		runnable.run();
	} finally {		// <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< here
	...

	Neither this place nor the one above make sense though.  
	In the code I have, there is no throw of IllegalArgumentException.

DS (9/18/01 12:06:29 PM)
	The exception is probably being thrown by the runnable.  Within this runnable
	we execute busyClose, which saves the state of each perspective ( and each part )
	in the window and then closes all perspectives ( and each part ) in the window.
	The problem now is to identify which part / class generated the exception.

	The IllegalArgumentException(String text) constructor is referenced by the following
	org.eclipse.ui classes ..

		ContributionManager.insertAfter -->  ""can't find ID""
		ContributionManager.insertBefore --> ""can't find ID""
		ContributionManager.remove --> ""can't find ID""
		ContributionManager.addToGroup --> ""group not found:""
		ImageRegistry.put --> ""ImageRegistry key already in use: "" + key
		TextViewer.setVisibleRegion --> ""TextViewer.error.invalid_visible_region_2""
		TextViewer.internalRevealRange --> ""TextViewer.error.invalid_range""
		TextViewer.setDocument --> ""TextViewer.error.invalid_range""
		StringConverter --> various places with different text.

	None of these seem related.
	A simple search for ""Argument cannot"" in eclipse ui yielded nothing. 

	I also unzipped the source for all of the plugins in core, jdt, pde, vcm
	and ui.  ""Argument cannot be null"" string is only defined in SWT.java
	as the error string for ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT.  This constant is referenced in
	69 files within org.eclipse.swt and is typically thrown whenever the input to
	an SWT method is erroneously null. 

	Conclusion: somebody passed null to an SWT control method. There is no
	indication which method was called or who called it.  I think we must wait 
	until we have a reproduceable case.

The general idea seems sound.  This is a PR in the desktop
since the desktop is in the right position to know when the platform is up and 
a 
refresh can be done.  If the resources plugin were to do this, it could cause a 
build
and then we could end up with UI plugins being activated before the UI is 
actually 
up and ready to go.  Basically this is a check and refreshLocal before entering 
the
read/eval loop in the UI.

----------------------- EC post

For those of us using external CM tools please add a preference entry to
refresh from local on startup.  The CM system replaces/adds files to the
file system and I wuld like to know that when I open WSW it is current not
holding on to old metadata and as a result generating compile errors that
are not in the real source files.

Even better would be to notice when file
modification times change from what you have in your metadata and prompt the
user to allow a refresh at that time.

I presume these was not done to improve boot time, but I would rather have
boot take an extra 30-60 seconds and get the correct results.  After all,
machines keep getting faster and someone can always turn off the option.

Correct.  The local location of the project is not a property that should be

WHen I do multiple consecutive Replace With -> Local History operations, 
more ""editions"" (timestamps) are created in the local history, even though 
I didn't make any changes and save them in the interim.

*In a java project in the Resource perspective, create a new file named Moo.java.
*In the Moo.java editor paste the following and save:
public class Moo {
      private int y;
      public Moo() {
      }
      public void doThis() {
      }
      abstract public void doThat();
      public int getX() {
       return x;
      }
     }
At this point there should be two versions visible in the local history, 
one with an empty class def, and one with the class def shown above.

*In the text editor, delete the following line and then save:
      abstract public void doThat();
Now there are 3 versions in the local history.

*In Nav, select the file and do Replace with -> Local History
Select the previous version.  I think this is when the extra version 
gets created but you will not see this until after the next step.

*Do another Replace with -> Local History
Select the top version.

BUG:
Now Select Replace with -> Local history and look at the number 
 of versions in the list - it has increased by one!  The top 2 versions are 
 the same code.  I haven't saved anything new since I started doing the Replace
with operations.

If you keep doing 'Replace with -> Local History', you get a new version after every 
second 'Replace with' you do.

Potentially we (core, the editor, compare, etc) could try and keep track of 
this kind of information but it would be very easy for this information to 
become out of sync with the actual contents of the local history since the 
local history can be flushed/pruned at any point in time based on a number of 
different policy settings.

status line message takes a lot of time (about 5.5% of the total time), even in the case where
there are no tasks in the task list at all! This is because it doesn't make use of the marker
deltas, but just asks Core to compute the complete set of markers for the given selection, depth, etc.
This information is already available, because the marker objects are in the table viewer.  It just has
to grab the set of markers currently visible in the table, and generate the appropriate summary message.
Even better, the task list content provider could incrementally update the summary information based on the
provided marker deltas.

NOTES:

JohnA (9/24/2001 3:20:02 PM)
	Another drawback of the current approach is that when the task list is first
	opened, fetching the markers twice causes two tree walks, that need to allocate
	lots of objects.  In an extreme case I was profiling, in a workbench with the entire
	eclipse source (11,000 files), opening the task list allocated 44,000 objects to fetch
	the markers twice.  The fourfold increase is due to the fact that it fetches two
	different kinds of markers each time (tasks and errors)."

2796,unknown63@eclipse.org,2001-10-16T21:05:24Z,4,0,"I sent an email for some background on the addition or not of 
groups for menus, toolbars, etc.  

I know it's been a long time, but I have a question about editor action
contribution for you.  In the html doc the following statement appears ..

menubarPath - a slash-delimited path ('/') that is used to specify the
location of the action in the menu bar. The last token represents the named
separator group into which the action will be added. If the path is
omitted, the action will not appear in menu bar.

toolbarPath - a slash-delimited path ('/') that is used to specify the
location of the action in the toolbar. The first token represents the
toolbar ID (with ""Normal"" being the default toolbar), while the second
token is the named group within the toolbar. If the group does not exist in
the toolbar, it will be created. If toolbarPAth is omitted, the action will
not appear.

There is an interesting difference here. For the menubar path, if the group
does not exist we currently ignore the action.  For the toolbar path, if
the group does not exist we add it and the action.  This behavior is only
implemented for editor actions.  For views, popup menus, and action sets we
automatically create the group if it does not exist.

Can you think of any reason why we don't want to add a group when it does
not exist?

Here is his response ..


The difference had more to do with practical considerations.The rationale at 
that time was the following:

1) The tool bar is shared (there is no hierarchy as in the menu bar).
Therefore an action in the tool bar becomes another thing you can press to
get something going. We felt it was OK for an ISV to add to the tool bar
(therefore toolbarPath becomes just a mechanism to retain some order if
there are named groups reserved for ISVs).

2) Pop-up menu means 'actions on the selected object(s)'. Again, we felt it
was OK for an ISV to add an object-related action. Named groups are again
just a visual organisation utility.

3) Menu bars have hierarchy. When you add an action into the menu bar, you
are not just adding it anywhere - it has to be under a certain menu. The
menu label implies certain classification so the likelihood to confuse
users is great. I can add an action 'Parse PDE plugin' into the
'Perspective' menu. The user would not be able to find it first, and then
would not understand what is the connection between perspectives and
parsing plugins. Since we recognized great danger from contributing into
the existing menus without menu owner's consent, we made an exception here
to only allow additions if there is an explicit group already declared for
exactly that purpose. If you want to see your actions in the menu bar and
think that none of the groups fit, you must create another top-level menu,
add it into 'additions' and then add your actions there. For example, if I
add the menu 'Plugins' and add my 'Parse PDE plugin' action there, it will
be much less confusing to the user.

Of course, nothing stops ISVs from adding 10 more top-level menus or from 
looking into the code and adding into
internal (non-published) groups. But at that point you know you are
breaking the rules and are on your own.

2. ImageRegistry does not provide methods for getting the ImageDescriptor,
only methods for getting the Image itself.

Response ..

Hi David,

org.eclipse.jface.action.Action.setXXXImage() takes only ImageDescriptor.

DS (9/12/01 11:06:27 AM)
	It is quite ironic that our own WorkbenchImages class hides this defficiency by storing
a map of descriptor to images, so we failed to notice it.  It is only because of the global image
cache in ActionContributionItem that we don't create more than one image.

Forum Response ..

Sharon,

<blush>
You are right.  The API on ImageRegistry does not reflect the API for Action. 
 In the workbench we have a map from image name to descriptor.  This makes it easier
 for us to get the descriptors which have been added to the registry and use them to
 initialize an action.  If the same descriptor is used in more than one action there is still
 only one copy of the image: the ActionContributionItem has a global image cache itself.  
Only 1 copy of the image is allocated, even if it is used in more than one action.

I have annotated the PR.

NOTES:

AW (11.09.2001 12:13:51)
	The Compare editor uses the normal Eclipse editor model: you work on a buffer and your workspace isn't
	modified unless you save the editor's content. For a Compare editor this means that you can merge and edit
	the resources shown in the structure compare pane without touching resources in your workspace. The benefit
	of this model is that you can always cancel all changes if you find in the 50th file that a merge isn't as simple
	as initially thought...

	The context menues of the left and right panes in the content compare viewer have no entry for Save because
	you cannot save the left hand or right hand side individually!
	You can save only the contents of the compare editor as a whole (all buffered changes). So there is a Save
	in the File menu (and thats the reason why Control-S works).
	It would be confusing if the context menu of the left and right-hand side would have a Save entry that doesn't
	save the corresponding side but the whole compare editor buffer.

	Note: this behavior is different from the behavior of the VCM tools. The VCM tools save changes to the
	underlying resource whenever you switch to another resource. But this doesn't follow the editor model.
	For 2.0 we have to decide what approach to use."

to change it's layout to the standard one file showing in the editor area, with 
any other open editor's being stacked (tabbed).
What is the intended behavior for the editor area when a perspective is reset?

STEPS:
(Your workspace needs to contain at least one project that has
2 or 3 files (e.g. .txt, .java)

*Open Resource perspective.  Close any editors you may have open.
*Undock some of the views to change the perspective.
*Open 2 .txt files.
*Change editor area layout by dragging one of the open editors to 
appear directly below the current editor area.  You should see one editor 
appear above the other.
*Now do Perspective > Reset
NOTICE: The views are correctly reset.  But the editor area still has 2 open 
editors appearing one above the other.
I EXPECTED: one editor area with all open files stacked (tabbed), since that it 
the way the editor area works the first time you open more than one editor in a

e.g. the icon is part of a menu and the menu item is selected, the icon has a ""halo"" around it in the previous background colour (grey/white).

This can be seen in the following places in Eclipse (win32):

- from the main toolbar, ""Run"" drop-down -> hover over any of the menu items - the running man has a grey halo
(image is plugins\org.eclipse.ui\icons\full\ctool16\run_exec.gif or similar)

- in the debug perspective, right click on the debug view to bring up context menu, and hover over any of the items.

On Motif, all of the views have a grey background by default, so this becomes a problem there as well:

- select a class which contains a ""public static void main"" method. The small running man icon appears beside the class in the outline view,
and the main method gets an ""S"" beside it's green ball.  Both images have white halos.

If the menu width is just affected by the Save and Save As filename lengths 
then I'd say go with just Save and Save As.  However, isn't it also affected by 
the MRU list?

I think the key here is to understand whether the real complaint relates to the 
legibility of the Save and Save As menu items (because of the filename ""noise"") 
or genuinely relates to the width of the menu itself.  If the latter then 
changes to the Save and Save As menu items aren't where the real solution lies.


"
2833,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2003-02-17T02:50:05Z,6,0,"Dani, could you please clarify whether the complaint is about the width of the 
File menu when there's a long name, or is it about the legibility of the Save 
actions when including then name?

There is definitely an issue with the width of the File menu.  For very long 
file names, the file menu can get ridiculously wide since we don't enforce a 
maximum size, as we do for the MRU list.
Rather than eliminating the name entirely, we could restrict its length so that 
the total length of the menu item is 40 chars or so (as we do for the MRU list).

But if you feel that it's too cluttered to include the name in the first place, 
we can consider removing it entirely.
"
2833,daniel_megert@ch.ibm.com,2003-02-17T08:39:56Z,7,0,"It's the length which is not limted and the fact that the name is used along
with Save/Save as... 

I can't speak for Linux and MAC but on Windows I don't know any application that
shows the file name along with Save/Save as... Some applications show the name
(limited to some number of characters) in their most_recent menu group.

I would check MAC and Linux and if they both show the file name in Save/Save
as... then we can limit the number of characters for the file name otherwise we
remove the name completely.

As.. menus. Will remove the file name from these actions for today's

2833,nick_edgar@ca.ibm.com,2003-02-17T17:17:12Z,9,0,"Julian adds:
Check with Dani whether there's an issue with even the 40 char limit (when I 
originally read the defect I assumed that the compliant would pertained to any 
string that approached even 20 chars).  I'm not sure what the correct limit 
should be,  but regardless of Dani's answer I certainly feel that any limit 
applied to the MRU list should be respected by the Save choices as well.  

Separately, should a tooltip appear over any truncated file name (I'm guessing 
this is not standard practice in the File menu; but I notice that the editor 
picker and the editor tabs do show the full file name in a tooltip if you hover 
over it).

Dani has clarified that he finds the names distracting, even if not too long.

	Fix is to add the following line to OLEEditor.init(...)
	if (!((IFileEditorInput)input).getFile().getLocation().toFile().exists())
		throw new PartInitException(WorkbenchMessages.format(""OleEditor.fileMustExist"", new Object[]{((IFileEditorInput)input).getFile().getFullPath()})); //$NON-NLS-1$
	and the following line to message.properties:
		OleEditor.fileMustExist=File {0} does not exist.

SA (9/14/2001 10:32:39 AM)
	Just another suggestion. We assume in the OleEditor class that the ClientSite will
	always be created and reference it in a few places in the code directly. We should
	check for a null client site as the creation could fail because of a problem with the
	OLE object itself of which we have no control of.

EJP (9/14/2001 10:46:46 AM)

(I believe that should not be relevant in this case)

If I have a java class (open in an editor) that has errors and I replace with another version in the local
history (that has a different number of errors) the Task list updates correctly but the markers in the editor 
disappear or do not display correctly (incorrect number of error markers are shown in the editor)

STEPS:
*In Resource perspective, create the following class:
public class TaskClass {
      private int y;
      public TaskClass() {
      }
      public void doThis() {
      }
      abstract public void doThat();
      public int getX() {
       return x;
      }
     }
Notice in the Tasks list that there are 2 errors.

*In the text editor, delete the following line and then save:
      abstract public void doThat();
Notice that there is now only one error
*In Nav, select the file and do Replace with -> Local History
Select the previous version (the one that has 2 errors)
BUG: Notice that the 2 errors show in the task list, but only the 
		""x cannot be resolved"" error has an error marker.

workaround: Close file and open it again.

Looks like this replace is causing one less marker to appear in the 
marker bar then there is (number of) errors in the task list (for that file).

to display incorrect data. 

In the Task list, if you specify filtering where
	1. only Java problems are shown
	2. on only the selected resource 
and then you exit and restart, the Task list does not recognize the selected resource
so the info it displays appears to be incorrect.

STEPS:
In the Resource perspective:

1. In a Java project, create a java class that has an error.  Example:
public class TaskClass {
      private int y;
      public TaskClass() {
      }
      public void doThis() {
      }

      public int getX() {
       return x;
      }
     }
2. In the Tasks view, notice the error that x cannot be resolved.  Now bring up the filtering dialog.
3. In the filtering dialog, check only Java problems and choose 'On selected resource only'
4. Select TaskClass.java in the Navigator view.  Notice that you can see the error.  Select another 
    resource; notice the error no longer shows.  Now select TaskClass.java again and verify the 
	error is showing again.
5. Exit eclipse
6. Restart eclipse
BUG: Notice in the Tasks view that you can no longer see the error, but TaskClass is selected in Nav
workaround: select the class again, you will see the error 

NOTES:

SA (10/4/2001 10:22:33 AM)
	I could only get this problem to occur if the navigator did not have focus when
	I exit eclipse and restart it. Then, the nav does not have focus, the file
	is selected, but the task view is empty. If I click on the nav view to give
	it focus, then tha task view updates to show the java error. If I give focus to
	another view, the task view continues to show the java error.

	Not too sure what the consequences are for the nav view to fire its
	selection if inactive? Maybe instead it's the task view responsibility
	to ask for the current selection of the provider when first hook
	up?"

		1GJW3AI: ITPVCM:WIN2000 - Compare with Stream Contents does not 
prompt for save changes.
		1GFMRMH: ITPVCM:ALL - Project compare: edited files aren't 
marked

	We are having problems implementing prompt-for-save-on-close 
functionality in our compare editor.

	Doing this properly seems impossible given the current compare 
framework. If we get rid of our implementation
	of VCMCompareEditorInput.isSaveNeeded(), then the when we close the 
editor we get the following behaviour:

	1. Editor says changes exist, do you want to save? (y/n/cancel)
	2. User says ""yes""
	3. CompareEditor.doSave() first sends setInput(null) to each pane, then 
sends save() to the CompareEditorInput.
	BUT
	setInput(null) sent to each pane may cause additional prompting 
(changes exist, do you want to save? (y/n/cancel))
	because, in ContentMergeViewer.inputChanged(), if fConfirmSave is true, 
the pane prompts for saving changes.

	We have no control over fConfirmSave, as it is a global setting. 
(Anyway, even if we did, we wouldn't turn it off
	because it is needed for the case that the user clicks on a different 
item in the tree).

	Why does this not happen in the normal (non-VCM) compare case? Because 
we enable the save actions in
	our editors, and in ContentMergeViewer.inputChanged(), the prompting 
only happens if the save actions are
	enabled.

	This code path needs to be fixed before we can prompt in this way.

2859,Kevin_Haaland@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T02:44:50Z,0,0,"During a ""New"" wizard, if an SWTError is thrown while building a wizard page,
the error is not handled, and the IDE process terminates abnormally (i.e. no proper
shutdown allowing edit sessions to save).  This will cause data loss and perceived
instability in the IDE.

The problem is likely going to happen with any runtime exception, but I've only
seen it with SWTError.  In particular, an SWTError was thrown under Linux when
Combo.setItems(list) was called where list[0] == null.  This doesn't cause an SWTError
in Windows.

To reproduce this, take any New wizard (eg new Java Project). In the 
createControl() method that builds the wizard page content as called by 
Wizard.createPageControls, manually throw an SWTError (throw new SWTError(""oops"");).  
This is just to simulate an actual SWTError that might be thrown for a variety of 
legitimate reasons such as low system resources.  With that throw in place, run the 
IDE and attempt to create the new object.  When you click Next from the first
wizard page, and it attempts to build the page we modified createControl for,
the IDE will simply shut down.  I expected that the error would be caught, and
the current operation (creating a new Java Project for example) would fail and
info written to .log.

Example:

1) Start with a workbench with the resources, team, and java perspectives open.
2) Switch to the resource perspective
3) Shutdown the workbench
4) Restart the workbench.  VCM and JDT components actively get loaded, because there
	is an open perspective belonging to those components.  Even if I never switch to those
	perpspectives, plugins have been loaded that didn't need to be loaded.  Since the perspective
	icon is available in the XML file, it is quite possible to just load the perspective and all its
	views when it is first activated by the user.

It is quite common for people to have at least resources, team, java, and debug perspective
open all the time, which makes for a slow startup time, because all those plugins have to
be started up right away.  If perspectives were loaded only on activation, the startup time
would be spread out over several intervals, thus reducing the perceived startup time for the user.

looks like the UI-level progress monitor can cause far too many UI events.
I think the culprit is jface.operation.AccumulatingProgressMonitor.

For example, if I have an operation that has 10,000 units of work, and I call
worked(1) 10,000 times, it may create 10,000 RunnableLock objects and do
10,000 asyncExecs to post them to the event queue, etc.  At the UI level, the
knowledge must be available of how many units of change can actually be
presented to the user.  By eye-balling it, it looks like there are only about 50
progress blocks in the indicator, which means only about 50 of those RunnableLocks
and asyncExecs can actually be changing what the user sees.  Shouldn't AccumulatingProgressMonitor
buffer those worked() calls until a meaningfully representable increment has been
reached, and then post something to the event queue?

Local refresh is an extreme example, but worked() calls were taking about 12% of
the entire operation. I wrote some simple code in core to do the buffering described above,
and it reduced this to less than 1% of the total time.

	Date: 10 Sep 2001 19:30:10 GMT

	Hi,

	I posted a related message about this before, but I'm wondering why
	Eclipse does not provide a way to open any file in an editor. It seems I
	need the file to be inside my workspace (which means it has to belong to a
	project), but there are situations when I do not want this (i.e. do not
	want it to be visible to the user through the navigator view). For
	example, I may have the file in a temporary location that I do not want to
	expose to the user.

	For situations such as this, what can I do? IStorageEditorInput seems to
	be read-only input, so that does not help. I'd appreciate any help.

	It is recommended that a plug-in developer create a public interface.
	This interface would contain all the menu/tool paths that other plug-in
	developers can use to extend. The interface role is to define the
	""contract"". That is, the plug-in developer is agreeing that these paths
	will always be available and supported. Those not listed in the
	interface should be considered off limits and subject to change in the

	As a developer wanting to extend another plug-in's menu, you can't use
	the interface constants in your plugin.xml file directly. That's why you
	need to ""piece together a path"" from the constants in the interface. For
	example, the path=""window/additions"" would come from piecing together
	IWorkbenchActionConstants.M_WINDOW and
	IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS

	Does this make more sense now?

	Subject: Checking for Existing Resources ""New"" Wizards
	Date: 19 Sep 2001 15:39:26 GMT

	A lot of people are using a subclass of WizardNewFileCreationPage in their
	""New"" wizards.  By doing so, they automatically pick up a check on whether
	the resource they are trying to create already exists, which is a nice
	feature.  This check is internally done by the ResourceAndContainerGroup
	class.

	However, I come across 2 problems with this check:

	1) No error is reported if a file with the same name but different case
	(capitalization) exists.

	2) No error is reported if a file with the same name exists in the file
	system but not in the workbench.  (This happens when you create the file
	on the system but did not perform the ""Refresh from Local"" action)

	Both of these issues will result in a failure when the user finally
	presses the ""Finish"" button.  You can easily verify this using the ""New
	File"" wizard from the Eclipse Workbench.

"
2877,dj.houghton@ca.ibm.com,2002-01-25T20:28:18Z,3,0,"Issue 1:

The problem arises because the workspace tree is case-sensitive and therefore 
most operations on the workspace tree are case-sensitive. There is currently no 
API in Core to provide a case-insensitive existance check for a resource in the 
workspace tree.

In order to work-around the above issue, one could potentially use a method 
like IContainer.findMember on the workspace root, and check for the proper 
child based on different casing in the path name segments. I would imagine this 
to be in-efficient, though.

Issue 2:

The issue of having resource created in the filesystem automatically showing up 
in the workspace tree (using filesystem callbacks) is not on the plan for 2.0 
and there is currently no API at the Core level which will tell you whether or 
not a resource exists in the workspace or filesystem, only whether or not it 
exists in the workspace tree. The Core API is based on the assumption that the 
workspace tree contains an accurate view of what is on the filesystem, with 
error handling in case that assumption is incorrect. (as you are experiencing 
with IFile.create)

Currently the only way to refresh the workspace tree with the current state of 
the filesystem is via a call to refreshLocal on the parent resource. Note that 
this will cause a build to run.

If you wish to test whether or not a resource potentially exists in the 
filesystem and not in the workspace, you could create a resource handle to the 
resource, call #getLocation (to resolve its location on disk) and then call 
#toFile (which converts it to a java.io.File), and then call #exists. Note that 
the behaviour at this point will conform to the spec for java.io.File. (not 
sure off the top of my head how they handle case sensitivity issues. Also note 
that this is a call to the filesystem, which may in actuality be a mapped 
network drive or some other case which could result in delays.

	The last issue is more of a feature request:
	
	It would be nice if the WizardNewFileCreatePage supports a file extension
	mask.  Our ""New Wizard"" automatically appends one if the user omits it,
	but the way we are doing it right now has 2 shortcomings:

	a) There is little user feedback that we will append an extension and what
	that extension is

	b) We have to override validatePage() in our subclass so that we will
	perform duplicate resource validation using the effective filename with
	the extension appended.

They are marked with this PR number.

NOTES:

DS (9/20/01 4:33:17 PM)

IWorkbenchTest fails because getActiveWorkbenchWindow does
not return the correct result just after opening a new window.  Silenio says this is because
X is asynchronous, and you have to wait a couple of events before a ""set"" call to the server
is reflected in ""gets"".  IN my own testing I found that Display.getActiveShell returns null whenever
the app does not have focus.  This may occur if you are running some other app.  I think
our use of it within getActiveWorkbenchWindow is a poor choice, and we should track the
""topmost"" window in another way.  If not, getActiveWorkbenchWindow is really useless.

IWorkbenchPageTest fails because we try to open an editor on ""a.null and void"" and
emacs is chosen when we expect the default text editor.  On Gnome the Program.findProgram
method appears to return a default program for extensions of strange type.  For instance, if
you pass ""a.null and void"" in it determines the mime type is text/plain and that the
appropriate program is gnome edit.  Silenio says the 2.0 swt stream returns null, 
so our own default text editor will be used.  I recommend we change the test to check if
an internal editor opens.  If so, then we do the current asserts.

IActionBarsTest fails because we open a view, then add global action handlers, then
try to run those handlers by firing the actions in the menu.  The handlers do not run
because the handlers are ignored until the part is re-activated.  I believe the update method
in ViewPane or ViewActionBars does not call its super class, so the action handlers
are not re-calculated when they should be."

I am passing along the words from our developer, who works on Linux.
He is using R0.9 (125)

    When I run Eclipse on Linux, I find that the Eclipse window is
overaggressive in grabbing keyboard focus (as indicated by
window manager border being highlighted, for example).  Whether in
click-to-focus mode or focus-follows-mouse mode, the         Eclipse
application will grab focus as it switches perspective.

    So, for example, I can start in Java perspective, then click to switch
to Debug perspective, and move my mouse to another             window.  But
focus gets grabbed away from that other window to the Eclipse window; click
on the other window, and Eclipse     may still grab focus back as it redraws
its own window.  Bad bad bad.  Focus grabbing is bad.  :)

	- Selection changes in the text editor aren't forwarded to the IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate.

One architectural issue: the IActionDelegate is the only concept where I receive selection changes for free (without registering for it).
Why isn't there some init method on IActionDelegate too. In this method I could access a selection service and hook up my own selection
changed listener if needed. Then we could remove the selectionChanged method.

	The java debugger contributes several viewActions to the generic debug UI - 
	for example, show/hide static fields, show/hide final fields, and use step filters.
	These viewActions specify a starting ""state"" (i.e. they are toggle actions).

	However, the viewActions state is not persisted across workbench invocations.
	When the workbench is restarted, the original toggle state is used, which may not
	be the state in which the user left an action.

	In order to properly synchronize our settings with the presentation of the settings,
	viewActions need to persist their ""state"" attribute."

2897,darin.eclipse@gmail.com,2005-08-04T13:15:51Z,3,0,"Yes - but the action delegates that use the preferences are not instantiated 
until a selection change occurrs. The net effect is that an action delegate 
(toggle) will appear unchecked, when the preference is in fact on, until the 
delegate is instantiated and the action delegate can initialize itself from 
the preference setting.

For example:
* in the variables view, ensure that ""Show Qualified Names"" and ""Show Static 
Variables"" toggle actions are on (in the variables view drop down menu).
* Restart the workbench, and realize the menu without launching a debug 
session - the actions appear unchecked when in fact they are ""on""
* start a debug session to a breakpoint
* select a variable
* now relaize the menu and see the actions are checked

The user can actually turn the toggles off without knowing it. The actions 
appear unchecked initially, and invoking the toggle has the net effect of 
instantiating the action, initializing from the pref (on), and then toggling 
the action off - which ios *very* confusing for the user."

2898,Randy_Giffen@oti.com,2001-10-11T02:45:43Z,0,0,"I would like a toggle in the navigator to show only the open resources.
Or perhaps this could be a separate view which I could make a fast view.
A separate ""open resources view"" should have a toggle to sort by resource hierarchy

This would be an alternative way to find an open editor rather than using the 
editor tab bar arrow buttons. 

NOTES:

JohnA (10/9/2001 10:09:51 AM)
	I like this idea of an ""open resources view""!! It is a real pain to manipulate all those
	little editor tabs.  To be really fancy, it could have an extensible set of layouts, such as:

	- resource hierarchical view 
	- type hierarchy view
	- sorted list view (by name or by path)
	- stack-based view (most recently opened at the bottom)

	This would also allow multi-select and range select for closing views.  Currently,
	if I want to close 20 of the 30 editors currently open, it takes a lot of fine motor
	control mouse work... very tiring on the hands."

5) Notice that all the objects allocated for the sync view are still around.

There is a memory leak in the compare FW that holds onto the DiffTreeViewer
instance, which means all the model objects inside it are held onto.  I suspect
the method DiffTreeViewer#handleDispose:

	protected void handleDispose(DisposeEvent event) {

			if (ps != null)

Notice that in handleDispose, it ADDS a property change listener, rather than removing.
I'm not 100% certain if this is the source of the memory leak, but it seems likely.

This is a fairly major bug, because it means users who frequently close the sync view
without syncing end up with large amounts of garbage being held onto.

the selection in a text editor.  There are some problems.

""
- IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate only receives structured selections changes.
I didn't find a way to track text selection changes right from  the beginning. As a result I 
have to keep the action enabled all the time.
- if a plugin gets loaded without a selection changed event, the action delegates don't get 
instantiated and we can't adjust the enable state.  This is only possible after the first structured 
selection change.
""

NOTES:

DS (9/25/01 9:39:41 AM)
	First the details: PluginAction only forwards IStructuredSelections to the action delegate.
	It drops simple ISelections on the floor.

	Now the workaround:  When the delegate is created we call an init(IWorkbenchWindow) method.
	The delegate should add a selection listener to the window in the init method.  Unhook the
	listener in the dispose method.  If this approach is taken you will get any selection fired out by 
	the text editor.

	Will your delegate compete with the PluginAction to enable the action?  I don't think so.
	If an IStructuredSelection is made the plugin action will process the selection and then
	call selectionChanged on the delegate.  You may override the action.  If an ISelection
	is made the plugin action will ignore it, and your own processing within the delegate
	can do the right thing.

	This problem in PluginAction will delay the accurate enablement of the action.  However, I do 
	not think this is very different from similar scenarios within the workbench.  For instance ..

	Action enablement is currently defined by xml.  Unfortunately, a number of plugins contribute 
	window actions with enablement criteria which cannot be described in our xml.  There is no 
	way to enable these actions correctly before they are instantiated, so the only solution is 
	to enable the action initially in xml so that the user can invoke it.  After the action has 
	been invoked the delegate can do the right thing.  An ""error dialog"" may appear 
	once, when you run the action for the first time, but only if the action is the first thing 
	in the plugin to be loaded.

	In Dirk's scenario we have an action which does not receive selection events.  I suspect
	that it is also impossible to define the enablement criteria for the actions correctly in this
	case, so this is just a variant on the scenario above.  Action enablement is only correct
	after the delegate has been created.  If the action enablement criteria in xml is always 
	enabled then the delegate may control the enablement with confidence after it has 
	been instantiated. 

DB (26.09.2001 10:33:35) 
	Hooking a selection changed listener on the selection service I can access via the workbench window doesn't solve
	the problem since I don't know the menu bar's action. The desktop doesn't pass the ""real"" action in the init method
	so I don't know which action to enable or disable. I only get the tool bar's action in run and selectionChanged. May be
	we should change the interface and pass the action on init and remove it from run and remove the method 
	selectionChanged.

	I know that I have to deal with the case that the action can be activated even if it can't work on the selected item. But we
	think that this is not the normal case. The refactoring actions make only sense in a perspecitive which deals with Java 
	elements so we assume that the user only adds the action set in those cases. If so, the Java plugin is loaded anyway and
	the desktop instatiates all action delegates implemented by JDT on the first selection change. If we could change the
	behaviour that the action delegates get instatiated on plugin loading (without triggering a selection change) than the
	enable/disable state of the contributed actions are correct in 99% of the cases.

DS (9/26/01 9:17:17 AM)	
	If we change (a) the point of instantiation to be plugin load, and (b) the selectionChanged
	strategy in PluginAction there is no need to change the interface.  When the plugin loads
	we can instantiate the action and then call selectionChanged, regardless of the current
	selection in the workbench.

	Note: If we did change the interface it wouldn't be a ""change"", it would be the ""addition of	
	a new interface"", so we would have IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate and
	IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate2.  

	All of these changes are only effective for 2.0, of course.  What version are you
	developing on?

DB (26.09.2001 16:10:09)
	Yup that's correct. The only advantage of changing the interface would be, that the action itself could deceide if it is interested
	in selection changes, instead of implementing an empty method. This would be consistent with the rest of the desktop, where
	I have to register a listener to get informed about selection changes. But changing the API is a bad approach too.

	I am developing on the 2.0 stream."

From: jsussman@us.ibm.com (Jeremy Sussman)
Newsgroups: eclipse.tools
Organization: http://www.eclipse.org
Date: Sep 26 2001 11:50:26

We're working on some plugins for Eclipse, and we've come up with an issue
on which we would like some guidance.

Basically, the main file that a designer would create for our scenario is
an XML file.  We are going to create a special editor for this type of XML
file -- that is, if you are using our Schema (or DTD), we are going to
give you a special editor.  We call these files ""GIR"" files.

The problem we are struggling with is how to name these files so that
Eclipse will bring up our editor.  We seem to have come up with three
alternatives:
1. Keep the GIR file as any old *.xml, and register our special GIR editor
for all .xml files
  Advantages: leverage other xml tooling
  Disadvantages: ""pollution"" of the editor space for non GIR xml files;
our editor won't be the default one - usability issue for regular users of
our system.
2. Have a new file extension *.gir  and register our editor for that
extension
  Ad: easy usability within Eclipse for normal usage
  Dis: can't use xml tooling.
3. Have a fixed file name, e.g, gir.xml  and register for that;  the
project name and other details can be derived from internal data inside
the file and from the container name (i.e., the Eclipse project), and not
be encoded in the file name -- kind of like the generic index.html
  Ad: can use xml tooling, easy usability within Eclipse
  Dis: will this hold up in the real world???


I'm wondering what the Eclipse vision is on this sort of thing.  Clearly,
there are going to be many XML files which should be editted in special
ways based on their schema/DTD -- I think this is part of the XML vision.

Thanks,
Jeremy

This is the preferred approach.  If taken the external tools work and all of the internal xml 
editors, including your own, can be used to edit the file.  This has the advantage that 
different users can edit the file in different ways.  I know that I prefer to edit xml as text.  

If you create the file yourself you can set the default editor.
Use the following code:

WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getEditorRegistry().setDefaultEditor(IFile,
String)

Once the default has been set it will be stored locally.  If the user opens the file the default 
editor will be used.  If the file is stored in a repository and loaded by other users they will 
not get the default.  However, as soon as they open it (using Open With) their preferred 
editor will be registered.

I know this is a weak solution.  In 2.0 I expect we will consider the idea of a
""mime type generator"", which can determine the file sub type from the first 128 bytes 
or so.  I have created a feature request.

1GKNZLW: ITPUI:ALL - EC: Need Mime Type Generator

Dave"
2917,bob@objfac.com,2002-04-13T06:36:04Z,1,0,"Obviously, one platform-supplied generator won't be able to anticipate all
possible content-based distinctions between file types, even those with a given
extension. But as long as plugins get to contribute mime-type generators (and
generators don't have any arbitrary restrictions, like the first 128 bytes) this
solution will work. At least I thought so when I last implemented it. ;-}

But it has some drawbacks:

1) Plugins can say what type of files they _can_ edit, even that they wish to be
the default editor, but not that they must be the only editor for a given file
type. Users must be able to override the editor choice, which in this case means
some sort of type-based configuration UI in addition to the current
extension-based one. This extra level of indirection isn't as easy for users to
understand.

2) Mime types have a few conventions, but except for syntax and a few common
examples in RFCs and in use they are just made-up strings. What mime type
corresponds to ""Java source files containing subclasses of Composite"" (an actual
requirement)? When plugins make up mime types it is possible to have accidental
collisions (same name for different kinds) and disjunctions (different name for
same kind). This can be confusing for users.

3) The concepts of kind and encoding are all mixed together in mime types. For
example, ""text/xml"" and ""application/xml"" are two MIME types describing the same
content with different encodings. If you depart from mime types, then you are
off inventing your own type signatures. I went down this path once. Believe me,
there is no end to the information people will want to encode in these
signatures. And it is not hierarchically structured.

When all is said and done, it is probably simpler and more flexible to implement
the following:

a) Allow plugins to declare what they edit by file extension, as they do now.
b) Allow users to configure what editors are applied by file extension (or name)
as they do now. But extend this so users can configure multiple editors for a
given extension (an ordered list).
c) Add an interface that allows an editor plugin to inspect its input and return
true (yes, it's for me) or false (no, pass it on). This works like pluggable
mime type generators, but without the type baggage. To minimize overhead, the
interface can be called in a separate plugin class before the IEditor and
friends are invoked.

rather see this happen at build time - some kind of interface to do this 
would be associated with the editor extension point.  This would be invoked when 
the any file of the type was saved ( and built ) and the builder would then 
accept or reject the file.  It could also register itself as the default if it 
wanted to.  This would affect whether the file appeared on the pop-up, and also 
when the file was opened without specifying a particular editor."
2917,bob@objfac.com,2002-04-15T18:29:46Z,3,0,"Not all editors have any concept of ""build"". Do we want to force them to? Since
builds occur when a file is saved, do we want each file re-examined on every
save? This seems to be unnecessary overhead.

I understand a concern about the cost of examining files on every open, but
that's not what I meant. Unless the user did something overt to indicate that
the nature of the file has changed, like saving the file with a different
extension, changing the editor for a specific file or changing the default
editor for the file's extension, the file would never be re-examined."

In sniff+ we use the metapher of ""pinning"" tools. Unless you pin
an editor, new files will be shown in the unpinned editor. If the
file is not saved (in the current unpinned editor), you will be 
asked. If you have a pinned editor showing the file, this editor 
will pop in front.

In general, there could be a (customizable) reuse strategy for each
editor type....

	is being requested. One is these ""dymanic action sets"" would
	be limited to one perspective. But what is a user makes the views
	and editors of that perspective visible in another perspective...
	how do they get these dynamic actions?

    ---------------------------

	Here is an e-mail I got with more info, followed with the 
	thread in the newsgroup.

	For example if you had a Java source editor that had a toolbar item that
	allowed you to create Javadoc and then you specified an external api 
that
	would allow other developers to create menu actions that could transform
	the Javadoc to Javadoc in XML form or whatever other form. Now the 
second
	step is that you have along with your source editor multiple ways of
	viewing the Java source. One way could be methods view of course. The
	analogy being that an external file could be one way of externalizing 
the
	tool manifest. This tool will have to work when a view or the editor 
itself
	is active. This is an example of what I am trying to accomplish.
	
	So when I click in one the views, I would like my menu items and toolbar
	that I load from the external XML file to be available. The other rather
	interesting feature is what you eluded to, an administrator could 
possibly
	limit the tooling available to end users by providing different xml 
files
	that describe the tools available and of course where to load the code 
for
	the tools.
	
	>Am I correct to say that one of your requirements is a way to add a

	>that these global items can only be added to your perspective(s) and 
the
	>user would not be allowed to add them to other perspective(s) (like 
they
	>can with action sets)?

	Yes.

	>Other question. This external xml file, is it only known at runtime?
	>Does the content change depending which user is running, or what access
	>level you have, or etc. Or is the content of the external xml file
	>always the same?

	Yes only known at runtime because it could change depending on the user.
	However, base functionality is always provided. In anticipation to an
	answer you would give pertaining to the above mentioned fact, if one 
could
	add my action set to another perspective, I would not want to create 
action
	sets because my tools or actions are definitely plugin specific to my
	plugin's editor and views.

	>If it is always the same, could you not create them as action sets in
	>your plugin.xml? (assuming there was a way to support the requirement I
	>listed at the start)

	It could potentially be partially consistent although it would seriously
	breach the requirements on myself. To elaborate, I mean some parts of 
the
	external xml file may refer to base functionality.

	Thanks again for responding promptly and I am eagerly awaiting your
	response to this note.



	> Other question. This external xml file, is it only known at runtime?
	> Does the content change depending which user is running, or what 
access
	> level you have, or etc. Or is the content of the external xml file
	> always the same?

	Thanks again Simon, precisely, I need for this global menu/tool items to
	be available only in my perspective. The reason for this is that the
	external xml file can change precisely for the reasons you mentioned 
i.e.
	depending on user access level or even just by manually replacing this 
xml
	file.

	> Am I correct to say that one of your requirements is a way to add a

	Simon the ability to add items into the toolbar and menu also allowing
	them to be available and accessible by both independent views and 
editors
	is born out of the fact that these views are really attached to this
	particular editor and yes users cannot attach these action sets to other
	perspectives although the prospect of a utility like this is a rather
	tantalizing one.

by the valueChanged method. Because of this if the value ever goes
invalid (due to a validator, which can decide what is valid beyond the
simple list used by the dropdown) it can never be changed to valid and

by Joe Winchester on Oct 1, 2001

The class org.eclipse.jface.action.Action ( and its interface IAction )
have a run() method that is called when the action is activated.  If the
action is on a toolbar is there any way to know what keys were pressed
at the same time  ?  For example, if you have an action that you want to
do one thing if it is pressed and a different thing if it is pressed
together with the Alt or Ctrl keys.


NOTES:

DS responds:

Short Answer: No.

Long Answer: If you contribute an Action to a menu the key state is passed
to the ActionContributionItem when the widget is selected.  Unfortunately
it is not passed to the IAction, and you can't get it.  If you wish to
copy / write your own ActionContributionItem you may catch the state as it
is passed.

If you contribute an Action to a toolbar the key state is not passed when
the tool item is selected.  SWT just ignores the key state.

In either case you could call OS.GetKeyState to get the underlying
keyboard state.  However, the resulting value will differ on various
platforms.  In addition, the key value may change between the time the
menu is invoked and the time your action is called.  This is more common
on X, where all events / queries are queued.

NE (10/04/01 11:04:05 AM)
	Added run(Event) to IAction and Action, changing Action.run() to a no-op (used to be abstract)
	and making Action.run(Event) simply call Action.run() for backwards compatibility.
	Changed ActionContributionItem to call run(Event).
	Fixed up some places in the UI to pass on the event, but others remain to be done.
	e.g.
		org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/WelcomeItem.java
		org/eclipse/ui/texteditor/AbstractTextEditor.java
		/org/eclipse/ui/texteditor/RetargetTextEditorAction.java
	To see these, delete IAction.run() and build.

	Also need to fix up action delegates.
	Could add IActionDelegate2 with run(IAction, Event), and change PluginAction.run() to be run(Event).

NE (10/05/01 4:26:22 PM)
	Had to change run(Event) to runWithEvent(Event) in build 203 to avoid conflict in JDT debug.
	It has an Action subclass which implements IViewActionDelegate, and has a call run(null) which is
	then ambiguous with IActionDelegate.run(IAction).

The multi-select behavior in the property sheet where only the common properties are shown is really cool.  
However, the values shown for the common properties are the values for the last selected element.  
What would be really nice would be if the values shown for a multi-select would either be an actual value if
ALL of the selected elements shared that same value, or some placeholder value that indicated there were 
multiple values otherwise.  The situation we've run into involves the enabled property for breakpoints 
(a boolean property).  If I multi-select a bunch of breakpoints, and want to disable them all, if the last breakpoint
I selected is already disabled, I have to first choose enabled, then disabled to disable them all.  Any thoughts?

NOTES:
	RG (10/2/01 9:43:25 AM)
	Currently we just show the value for the first item in the selection.	
	The property sheet entry could detect the case where the items have different
	values for a property and show some default label.
	The cell editor would still open with the value for the first item but we would always apply the new value to

As far as I can follow, there has been quite a few discussions in this newsgroup
on what kinds of changes might be better for editor presentation. For my part,
I'd like to see an easier way to manage a large number of editor windows and
better handling of browsing through packages, classes and methods in Java (or
other constructs contributed by different plugins). There has to be a way to use
a single editor window for a number of different editor inputs. Conversely, the
idea of ""pinning"" editors to inputs to make sure the content of a particular
window stays the same is very useful and should go hand in hand with the
previous item. A browser-like history with pulldowns that show both classes and
members (useful when you browse through a class using the outline) recently
visited along with keyboard shotcuts available anywhere in the window (Alt+left
and Alt+right is pretty much standard) should be in the platform. 

Somewhat related to this, the package view  in JDT could use an optional two
pane configuration to list packages and classes seperately. There is too much
scrolling right now, especially in a project with a large number of classes."

	Summary: The preference dialog should have a maximum size so it will never be bigger then the display.


I have opened a problem report with your comment about a maximum size for the dialog. I agree the it should never get bigger then your display.

As a workaround, you can use getControl() and get/set its bounds if the size is too big. There is API in Display to get the display bounds so you can compare the dialog bounds with the display.

But I have to say that I agree with Randy and about the size of the preferences dialog. It should not be made too big and I think 70% is too big. If you have a text that needs a big area to be shown, if may be a good idea rethink about your page as Randy suggested.

Hope it helps.

I'm okay with tabbing to the right place on the line using Eclipse, but 
I'd love it if (either at save time or key entry time) it could convert 
the tabs into spaces. Is there any way to do this? I know that the code

behave when the view is deactivated.

Related to 1GJUNL6: ITPUI:ALL - EC: PropertySheetViewer.setInput() does not save editor value.
This is sort of a follow up problem to 1GJUNL6

The problem is that when you edit a field in the Properties view (or the the description in the Tasks view) 
then you click on something else (another program, somewhere else in the workbench - doesn't matter 
if it is another part, an editor, the toolbar, or whatever) the edited value should be accepted as the 
new value AS SOON AS you click on that something else.  I guess that means as soon as the part is 
deactivated, the value should be accepted.

Example 1:
In the Tasks view, bring up the context menu and create a new task
Click on the Description field to edit
Type some text to change the description
Click somewhere else, for example on the editor or the Navigator.
	Also try clicking on another open program, like Netscape or the file Explorer.
Click on the title bar of the Tasks view
Hit Esc key
BUG: The new value you typed in step 3 should have been accepted when 
you clicked somewhere else in step 4

Example 2:
Install the property sheet example by loading the project org.eclipse.ui.propertysheet
	from the desktop repo.
Run your target.

In the target:
-Create a file called me.usr; open the file in an editor
-Open the Outline and Properties views if not already open
-In the Outline, expand nodes until you see first names; click on 'richard'
-In the Properties view, expand the address category.  Click on the city field to 
 edit.  Enter Ottawa as the new city
-Click somewhere else, for example the editor (the Nav or the Outline are bad examples
 of part to click in this case since set input on the Properties view).  Also try clicking on another 
 open program, like Netscape or the file Explorer.
-Click the title bar of the Properties view
-Hit Esc
BUG: the value was not accepted when the Properties view lost focus

If you're using the simple file wizard, this behaviour is hardcoded in

wizard.
What's your scenario?

NE (10/9/01 12:08:35 PM)

I was curious to know if I could prevent this since it has the overhead of
loading the plugin.
Maybe creating a wizard page is the answer for now.

NE (10/9/01 12:08:40 PM)
So you want to be able to create new files, but not edit them right away.
I assume you'll go back and edit them later?

Would it suffice to add a global preference to enable/disable automatic
opening of editors when files are created?

NE (10/9/01 12:08:49 PM)
RH says:
Sounds good to me.  I just thought of a more valid case:  The file type
being created has no internal Editor, only extenal, such as an Image file.

Should wizard writers be able to ignore/go against this preference?  Can
they have access to it so as to respect the setting?

NOTES:

NE (10/9/01 11:28:03 AM)
It has to do with them being created as child shells of the window, rather
than being top-level windows in their own right.
This allows Eclipse UI and the underlying window system to manage them
together.
e.g. menu and toolbar of the main window apply to detached views; minimizing
main window also minimizes detached views

However, torn off views do tend to obscure the main window.

		I've seen this. It's pretty painful. We need to identify (at 
every level)
		places where we are gratuitously painting multiple times.

		Could the line blanking have anything to do with X buffering?

	KR (10/10/01 4:16:15 PM)
		Where in drawStyledLine did you put the trace? I assume outside 
the loop that iterates
		over the styles. drawStyledLine renders a complete line so if 
you set text it should
		only be called once for each line.
		Maybe you don't notice the slow painting much on Windows 
because 
			a) it is better at merging paints (a guess)
			b) it draws faster (a fact)

		StyledText redraws the line when a character is typed. Eclipse 
uses the setStyleRange API
		to update the styles which in turn does another redraw. These 
two redraws should normally 
		be merged by the OS or by SWT paint merge code on Motif.
		If drawStyledLine is called 15 times for the same line when 
typing one character in a simple 
		file (no syntax coloring) Eclipse is likely doing something 
bogus that causes 15 redraws.
		If I type a character in the SwtStyledTextUseCase 
drawStyledLine is called once, regardless
		of whether Java syntax coloring is turned on or not.	

	BGS (10/10/2001 4:35:45 PM) -
		I put the trace as the very first statement in drawStyledLine
(), so we're talking about the
		number of times drawStyledLine() gets called as a whole.

2992,hudsonr@us.ibm.com,2002-01-22T20:52:39Z,3,0,"""We cannot auto-dispose controls which previously were not disposed when the 
page's dispose method is called"".

I do no understand this comment.  Currently, we DO auto-dispose controls some 
of the time, and we don't other times.  That is the point of the PR.

A page *must* dispose its control itself in the case where the EditorPart was 
closed and the Outline remains open.  A page *must not* dispose its control 
itself (because it is already disposed) in the case where the EditorPart 
remains open and the OutlineView is closed.

So, the change will be non-breaking because all properly-written IPages already 
dispose (unless already disposed) the Control when IPage.dispose() is called.

My concern is that developers do not check for control.isDisposed() in 
IPage.dispose() because they never tried closing the OutlinePage while leaving 
the EditorPart open."
2993,carolynmacleod4@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:47:25Z,0,0,"I just got 203, and tried to start it with my slightly old (136) workspace.
	Since the workspace was somewhat old (I have been away for 3 days) I decided to do a Replace with->Stream element
	on the org.eclipse.swt project to do a ""brute-force catchup"" and bypass the compare.

	I got an 'Unable To Replace' error dialog saying ""Resource is out of sync with the file system: /org.eclipse.swt/bin/org.zip"".
	I tried it several times, with the same result.
	It destroyed the old state of my project - there's a whole bunch of stuff missing (and since I had autobuild on, I had a zillion errors).

	I decided to delete the project and try adding it from scratch.
	Eclipse would not let me delete the project, because it said it was out of sync with the file system.
	But I really want to delete this project, because it is whacked and broken somehow.
	I should be able to delete it, even if it is out of sync with the repository.

	In case it helps any, here are the various walkbacks in the .log file from me trying to delete the project, and then I tried
	deleting various resources inside the project as well, with no luck.

	(I was able to do a catchup, even though I did not care about the changes, so at least my workspace was not scrapped).

	While releasing > 1000 resources to a server, I received ""Problems"" dialog with the message:
		""Problems occurred synchronizing the selected resources"".

	When I looked at the ""details"", the message was: ""SeverException.""

	To create the workspace:
	1) Start a new empty workbench
	2) Turn auto-build off
	3) Create projects & solutions by importing from file system into
		the following project structure (available on ""ftp.min.oti.com"", outgoing/eBAF/1FW747src.zip)
		(Created each project as a Java Project, with a server property of ""mercury"")
			Tp1NLS
				Tp1Compiler
				Tp1Core
				Tp1DAV4J
				Tp1JavaModel
				Tp1WebDAV
				Tp1XML

	4) Select the solution and release to the server.
	5) Received error message

DJH (6/8/00 9:31:37 AM)
	Was able to release solution OK to machine here in Ottawa. Some questions:
	- did you get a single error message or multiple ones with the same ""ServerException"" message?
	- were some of the projects already on the server when you went to release them?
				
DW (6/8/00 8:45:13 AM)
	I received a single error message.
	I tried several times, with new project names each time - thus the projects were not
	already on the server.

PCD (6/8/00 2:01:46 PM)
	Could reproduce the bug in the JDK version (0.21) but not inside VAJ.

DJH (6/8/00 4:25:03 PM)
	Was able to release onto gold using both VAJ and JDK. A local/remote server thing maybe?

DJH (6/8/00 6:10:16 PM)
	Was able to release to hydrogen on JDK. Weird.

DW (6/9/00 10:18:49 AM)
	I caught this exception by instrumenting code - I found that a DAV4JSystemException was being
	thrown, and I added a printStackTrace() to:

	public DAV4JSystemException(Exception e) {
		super();

	In some cases, users may experience problems when releasing a large number of 
	resources (>1000) while running the WebSphere Studio Workbench Java 1.2.2 Edition.

	The problem occurs during a release and is made known to the user through a ""Problems"" 
	dialog with the message: ""Problems occurred synchronizing the selected resources"".  
	The ""details"" of the problem indicates that a ""SeverException"" has occured.  In general
	this problem is not fatal in that released and unreleased resources are consistent in
	both the server and the workbench.  Re-releasing the resources which did not get released
	resolves this problem.

	Unfortunately, the cause of the problem is related to the a subtlety in the TCP implementation
	in Windows NT (Win98 users will not experience this problem) which prevents sockets 
	from being reused effectively.  As such, immediately retrying the release operation will 
	not always work.  Users may have to wait until the TCP stack clears some unused sockets 
	before attempting to release the resources.  This may take a number (1-4) of minutes.

When renaming projects, the ISV needs to be able to validate the name.  Presently name validation
can occur on creation by writing the right code in the creation wizard, but for rename there is
no place to control this.  Some projects, such as web projects, may have more restrictive naming
conventions since the naming must conform to WAS web app naming.

Perhaps rename can be done via the primary project nature.

3000,jeffmcaffer@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:47:33Z,0,0,"There is a problem wrt how java.io.File surfaces hidden files.  
For a hidden file
	File.exists() => true
	File.isFile() => false
	File.isDirectory() => false
For a hidden directory
	File.exists() => true
	File.isFile() => false
	File.isDirectory() => true

As a result, the workbench gets confused when refreshing against the local 
disk.  The 
hidden files show up in the File.list() result but then we try isFile and 
isDirectory
and both return false for the hidden files.  

Some of the workbench code uses the pattern
	if (file.isFile())
		<do file stuff>
	else
		<do dir stuff>
In the case of hidden files we end up doing the <dir stuff>.  

This problem must be addressed across the board by ensuring that hidden files
are either ignored or not ignored.  Which ever choice is picked, the policy must
be consistently applied.

RTP (4/18/01 9:24:25 AM)	
	There is a java.io.File.isHidden() method. It says that on Windows it 
relies on the attribute hidden
and on UNIX if the name of the file starts with ""."".
	On Windows we can change use the natives and treat hidden files as 
inexisting ones. I would not
bother having a ""hidden behaviour"" under Linux.
	How does that sound?

RTP (4/18/01 9:49:55 AM)
	I did not get the same results from java.io.File as the ones above. In 
fact, I've got reasonable ones.
Windows NT FAT:

Hidden file:
isHidden()		true
exists()	    		true
isFile()				true
isDirectory()	false

Hidden folder:
isHidden()		true
exists()	    		true
isFile()				false
isDirectory()	true

JM (4/18/2001 5:25:36 PM)
	Clarification request.  Are these new results are done using the new 
Core DLL?  This looks promising. 
	Will have to test on all platforms/filesytem combinations.

	I agree wrt ignoring hidden files.  They just do not exist from our 
point of view.  The UNIX 
	approach of '.' = hidden is NOT good.  We have filters wihch allow us 
to hide '.*' files in the 
	UI.  Files starting with '.' should be considered Visible.

RTP (4/20/01 4:45:54 PM)
	No, the results were from using java.io.File on VAJ.

3000,rgobeli@prodigy.net,2015-04-16T16:11:55Z,6,0,"The problem is that there are two hidden attributes.  Eclipse has a hidden attribute and the file system has a hidden attribute.
These may be getting confused in the above comments.

In windows the Java system makes a file with hidden file attribute unwritable.  Here is the issue, the description file .project is hidden, when this file is imported form a Mac or Unix system.  The project name can not be changed, because the .project file is not writable.

At this point java makes the .project file unwritable even though the read only file attribute is not set.
This got changed back in version 1.5 of java.  Sun assumed that hidden files should be write protected, but that was not windows intent.
Windows just intended to make files hidden from the user so if they did not know the name they could not change them, but the windows system can still see the files and change them in the system.  The attribute to protect files is the readonly attribute in Windows.

So now there is this case where the .project file is not writable in a project that is loaded into a windows workspace from a different operating system.
This bug has already been fixed in the CDT system for .cproject files, but the .project descriptor file is used outside of the CDT system.  So CDT could not fix it.

I have made a patch to the file system resource manager to clear the file hidden attribute when the eclipse system tries to write to the .project descriptor file.
This patch attachment is loaded on bug 194216.  There does not seem to be anybody monitoring this bug, because I have not got any response for over a year.

The check for a windows system could be removed, because the unhidden descriptor file should not stop other systems from working correctly.  The Mac will just reset the hidden attribute.  No harm done.
The isWindows could be always true and only the three lines in the if statement are needed.  I have tested this on my windows machine using the latest Java and Windows 7.
added code below is added between the following lines of code in FileSystemResourceManager.java just before the descriptor file is written.

 		ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(newContents);
 		IFileStore descriptionFileStore = ((Resource) descriptionFile).getStore();
 		IFileInfo fileInfo = descriptionFileStore.fetchInfo();
+
+              // For a windows system files need to be unhidden to be writable.
+		// any time description file is written, make it unhidden in the filesystem.
+		final boolean isWindows = System.getProperty(""sun.desktop"").equals(""windows""); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$
+		if (isWindows) {
+			ResourceAttributes descriptionFileAttributes = descriptionFile.getResourceAttributes();
+			descriptionFileAttributes.setHidden(false);
+			descriptionFile.setResourceAttributes(descriptionFileAttributes);
+		}
+

                if (fileInfo.getAttribute(EFS.ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY)) {
 			IStatus result = getWorkspace().validateEdit(new IFile[] {descriptionFile}, null);
 			if (!result.isOK())

Hopefully someone can see this solution and have it committed to the master branch.

This PR tracks the usability problem that the user has when he tries
to delete anything which is still held onto by the MS Windows Explorer.
E.g., when he tries to delete a solution and the explorer holds on to a
contained folder, the user has to perform the delete operation three
times (ignoring the error messages) to get rid of the solution.

NOTES:

JohnA/BB (6/15/00 6:44:54 PM)

We don't know how this can be handled in our code.

A workaround is to close the solution, delete the closed solution
(this works fine), and afterwards clean up things in the local file system
using the Windows Explorer.

If it's not the Windows Explorer which caused the problem (but,
e.g., the HTML editor) you might have to exit the application before
you can delete the local files and/or directories.

BB (6/19/00 6:51:58 PM)

This is a candidate entry for the README:

When deleting resources, problems occur if the file system object (file or folder)
for a resource is held onto, e.g. by an external application that has a handle to
a file or folder. Note that a resource can only be deleted if its members can be
deleted.
A workaround for this is to close the resource's solution and then deleting files
or folders from the local file system. If the file or folder is being held onto by a
plugin, it might be necessary to exit the application to be able to delete it from
the file system.
A closed solution can always be deleted. If the resource to be deleted is a project,
folder, or file, the ""Refresh from Local"" operation should be performed on the
solution after it is re-opened. If the resource to be deleted is a folder or file, it will
have disappeared from the workbench. If it is a project, the project can be deleted
after the ""Refresh from Local"" operation.

I've been using the Desktop  for some heavy Java programming, and so
I don't want to loose my changes.  Since I've had problems with crash
recovery (property store exceptions), I've taken to copying my solution
on the file system after a crash and then copying it back over and
refreshing local.  When I synchronize some files become forever 
""Workbench Better"".  It's never happened with class files (maybe because
they're recompiled all the time).

Steps to reproduce:  (feel free to change project/solution/server names, they don't appear to be important)

1. Create a new web project, solution: JkcaTestSolution37, project: JkcaTestProject37, server: mercury
2. Delete servlets & web folders
3. Create bin & src directories in JkcaTestProject37
4. Open properties on JkcaTestProject37
5. Add bin & src to classpath, ensure src is first & bin is second

DJH (6/23/00 9:04:38 AM)
	Interesting scenario. Here's what's happening:
	- user loads the solution from the server
	- this is doing a catchup with sync aspect of EXISTENCE so it brings structure into the workbench
	- then you put contents on disk
	- do a local refresh
	- the local refresh discovers the resources, marks the image file as workbench better
	  (since it wasn't on disk before)
	- but the sync aspect hasn't changed so when you go to release, it is skipping the
	  image file as its aspect is EXISTENCE.

	Need to investigate how local refresh handles discovery of content on resources whose content
	is not local.

JM (12/10/2000 2:29:34 PM)
	It would seem that discovering local content when the resource is not ""local"" would
	be considered an outgoing change (i.e., I changed/added content but that new
	content is not based on the server's content so it must be something new).

tests) on Linux (NFS) and Windows XP (Netware). 

Steps:
1 - add linked folder/file pointing to a NFS/Netware directory/file;
2 - disconnect the network cable
3 - refresh the project

Result on Linux: the refresh operation blocks trying to access non-available 
directories/files. The operation can be cancelled though. 10-20s after 
reconnecting the network cable, the operation completes successfully. In both 
cases, no errors are presented to the user. The same thing happens when trying

Result on Windows XP: the refresh operation faces a short delay trying to 
access non-available directories/files, and then proceeds. The operation 
completes successfully (no errors are presented), the linked resources cannot 
be accessed and are properly decorated as being broken (the children are lost, 
and so are their meta data).

An way to distinguish if a directory is empty or there is I/O errors accessing 
it is checking if java.io.File#list returns null. We could mark such nodes (and 
its children) as problematic and not discard them when refreshing. We could

3006,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-15T19:27:41Z,1,0,"This is a tricky situation.  The vulnerability is in the following two lines 
(from DeltaDataTree#reroot(DeltaDataTree)):

parent.setRootNode(backwardDelta.getRootNode());
parent.setParent(sourceTree);

Between the method calls to setRootNode and setParent, the tree
pointed to by ""parent"" will be inconsistent.  Any form of read
on the tree during that critical period will probably fail.  Note
that writes are not possible anyway because the tree must be immutable at this 
point already.  The failure mode could be bad, as it could hit an assertion (for 
example in DeltaDataTree#getChildNodes) that results in a runtime exception.  At 
least such a failure would only affect the read that happened during the 
critical region, and wouldn't leave the tree in a bad state.

This is expensive to fix.  Making it safe would require an extra sync block for 
every tree read, where currently no sync block is needed.  This would slow down 
all tree reads.

So the final question is: do we make it safe, thus impacting performance for all 
tree operations, or risk the rare failure and leave it as-is?  Since there has 
never been a report of failure here, and it would only cause read-only 
operations to fail (which by definition can't do much damage), I would suggest 
leaving it."

- creates a file under the .metadata folder, which contains the path of an index 
file in the TMP directory (c:\documents and settings\username\local

- writes cache information to this index file in the TMP directory.

This means that every new workbench you run, you get one of these cache files.  
This of course includes workbenches created by tests, etc.  My TMP directory had 
over 500 of these files (all empty).

The intended use is when we are running Eclipse plugins from other than the file 
system (eg. from http server). The current code stream does not fully support 
this configuration (ie. will not actually work if you try it), but some of the 
base core mechanisms were enabled. So the idea was to cache plugin jars and 
other files for actual execution. Wanted to be able to make use of the plugin 
jars/files regardless of what workbench you were running with (ie. single 
Eclipse cache, rather than per-workbench). So there was a per-workbench index 
written, but the actual files were cached only once (in the future wanted to 
merge even the separate index files).

The problem is that we obviously did not take into account the various test 
launchers (that create temp workspaces)/ continuous switching of workspaces with 
self hosting. So each time you create a new workspace, new index is written. 
Currently there are no mechanisms for managing the cache.

are dispatched are those from the moment of registration. PDE Error Log view needs to
show logs that happened before it was opened. 

An API is needed that parses the current content of the .log file and returns
an array of IStatus objects. PDE Error Log could use it to display logs that
happened from the moment of the workbench startup.

PDE could write a parser itself, but there are two disadvantages to it:

1) PDE does not own the .log file.
2) It is not good to separate code that writes and code that reads the same
file format. Since .log file format is private to the Core, it has the privilage
to change its format without notice. All PDE cares for is to get an array
of IStatus objects.

	Clarification needed:  
		- What should happen with the exceptions which are dumped to the
			log?  On parsing/reading the log we are not keen on somehow rebuilding the exception 
			objects.
		- In what form should the returned value be? (Status objects, strings, ...?) 

	Awaiting info...

DG (5/6/2001 11:45:36 AM)
   1) Of course, it would be ideal if rebuilt status objects would not differ from those logged after
   the log view has been activated. However, all I really need is the actual stack dump 
   of the exception, not the exception object ifself. If you could create an IStatus implementation
   that will give me exception text instead of the object, I would be OK.

   2) This is related to 1). Error Log works with IStatus objects, so an array of IStatus objects
   would be ideal. On initialization, Error Log view would ask the Platform to give it all the
   status objects that have been logged until that moment (including those during the boot). 
   These status object will be shown as the initial content of the view. After that new status
   objects will be added on top as they are logged.

   BTW, this feature will allow users to clear the log so that only new status objects are
   seen as they arrive, but also to restore the entire log. For this reason, the method to
   parse the .log file and return status objects may be called even during the lifetime of 
   the Error Log view (each time people press ""Restore Logs"" button).

way, changing the syntax of the file will not immediately break all the readers.

What is written into the file are status objects, so a class that reads the 
file and converts them into status objects again would free you to change the 
syntax without breaking users.

It is also general Eclipse practice to have only one reader for each XML format 
(as opposed to several plug-ins being in the XML reading bussiness).

That said, if parsing XML is the best we can get for 2.0, I would take it :-)."

for the XML log file, which I will certainly make available to anyone who can

the core API.

The question we didn't agree on in the discussion is how the reader API would 
look.  There was interest in a wide variety of functionality for reading the log 
(only reading the ""x"" most recent entries, only reading errors from certain 
plugin(s), filtering by date, etc).  Rather than commit to a large chunk of API 
for reading at this stage, I think it's better to just publish the DTD and let 
others do the reading.  It's fairly straightforward to implement a SAX parser to

dwd (5/21/2001 4:02:50 PM) 
You can store long values in an index by chopping them up into sections and 
storing them in multiple
adjacent keys.  For example, the suppose you have a (key, value) pair to be 
inserted.  Generate new keys
of the form key.00, ... key.99 and pair them with values v00, ..., v99 where 
v00 is bytes 0 to 1999 of the 
original value and v01 is bytes 2000 to 3999 of the original value, etc.

An alternative is to store the value as a blob -- the size limit is 7K+, then 
then store the ObjectID returned
as the value of the key.  ObjectIDs are guaranteed to never be reused.  They 
are an ""open number"", 
""serial number"" pair.

If the object is very large, you can store it as a separate file and store the 
file name as the value.

We could have two (or more) different files in the workspace writing to the same file in the file system.
(e.g. test.java and Test.java)

RefreshLocal is also affected. Need to decide if when refreshing a resource that has an existing
location on disk, we throw an exception to warn the user or simply ignore.

	Given the scenario:
		Workspace contains:
			Abc
		File system contains:
			Abc, xyz

	Usecases and expected behaviour (on a non case sensitive FS):
	1) Rename Abc to abc => OK
	2) Create ABC => FAIL
	3) Create XYZ => FAIL
	4) Rename (in FS) Abc to abc + Refresh Local => DELETE Abc + CREATE abc

Also:
	Potential problem areas:
	- property store
	- history store
	- persisted markers and sync info
	- resource lookup in the tree

Notes from referenced PRs:

The following directory names are not allowed by Win98 or WinNT:
	con, com1, com2, ..., com9, lpt1, lpt2, ..., lpt9.

DJH (5/15/01 4:03:04 PM)

Action items/issues:

- UnifiedTree -> fix the merge code for workspace/filesystem resources
- how is #resourceFor affected by case-sensitivity on a case insensitive FS?
- create/move/copy -> existence checks
	- for example, for create:
		- create force false all the time and if there is a problem and force is true then
			check the names to see if we are ok
- case sensitivity information should be available on a per project basis since
	project content can occur across different filesystems.
- must be able to rename/change file casing (e.g. foo.java -> Foo.java)
- #setContents -> if someone changes the casing from underneath you, just set
	the content as per normal and the old resource will be removed/the new resource
	will be added during the next refresh local. Yes, this will be treated as an add/delete
	and remove properties, markers, etc.
- need a story for path validity. where does it happen? At the API level or below?

RTP (5/29/01 9:48:39 PM)

High priority:
	1) Need to be able to rename a resource changing only the case.
		1.1) Should handle using API and file system
	2) Create a resource (force TRUE) but a resource with different case exists on disk.
		The problem is to end up with two resources having the same location on disk.

Medium priority:
	1) Create a resource (force FALSE) but a resource with different case exists on disk.
		1.1) We should not create the resource and should find the existing one.
	2) Change a file case on disk and set the contents (keepHistory FALSE)."

Vlad and myself worked through the PDE discovery of external plug-ins
(plug-ins found in the installation of an Eclipse product that will be
used to run/debug).

We concluded that PDE will be fine if the following conditions are met:

1) There is an API on Platform similar to ""parsePlugins"" that can be
pointed to the Eclipse installation and will return a PluginRegistryModel
that includes installation filtering step. Basically, the API would answer
the following: for the input path representing the root directory/URL of
the Eclipse-based product, give me the list of plug-in models that the Core
will see when it eventually starts up the product. I will take the model,
call 'resolve' on it and take the final list of plug-in models that will be
presented to PDE users as valid external plug-ins for making dependencies.

2) When PDE comes to finally launch the run-time Eclipse, it may need to
further filter out the list of plug-ins if users turn them off in order to
override them with plug-ins in their workspace. PDE uses ""-plugins
<pde_working_file>"" for that. Vlad concluded that we need to ensure that
this option continue to work and that Core does not filter this list. You
can still resolve it, but filtering is not needed because filtering has
already been applied to creating it.

LC (5/25/01 10:43:29 AM)
Just to be precise - i had to run eclipse from bin/ due to the way the eclipse startup script was structured.
I suspect that .metadata and this tmp/platform would have been created wherever i invoke eclipse.
If the user can start eclipse from his/her own /home directory, then this wouldn't have been a problem.
However, defaulting the creation of user-specific files to the /home dir or a location specified by a flag

	Could the temp dir be moved to be in the .metadata dir somewhere?
	it is less than optimal as the same file may be downloaded by several different running 
	platforms but it might be safer.

VK (5/25/01 10:05:13 AM)
	Each running instance of the platform should in fact have its own index (the files are actually

for finding the class lib to compile against.  Under java.home it expects to see lib/rt.jar or some such.  For J9 
the lib structure is different (e.g., lib/jclMax/classes.zip).  This means that users cannot compile Java code using
Ant under J9.  

NOTES:

JM (6/8/2001 4:51:53 PM)
	1) the workaround is to move/copy the requires classes.zip file up to where the Ant adapter is expecting it to be.
	This is less than optimal but works.  

	2) The better answer if for us to add the ability to take a ""jre"" or ""jcl"" property and use that (if set) to spec the 
	location of the class lib
	
	3) An alternative is to add args to javac to handle the new function.  However this would require retooling the 
	build script generator to include the required values in the javac task

	4) A futher alternative is to create another adapter specificially for J9 and then allow this value to be spec'd when 
	running the ant script.

	Of all of these, #2 seems like the most realistic and flexible.  (of course #1 can be done now by users).

AE (9/3/2001 5:38:02 PM)
	I assume that this PR is the result of the problem I had with the PDE.
	The assumption that the run time library is always on $java.home/lib/rt.jar is wrong.

	In org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.JDTCompilerAdapter the following is written:

		 .addExisting(new Path(null, System.getProperty(""java.home"") + ""/lib/rt.jar""));

	this should be:

		 .addExisting(new Path(null, JavaCore.getClasspathVariable(""JRE_LIB"").toOSString());

	Warning: according to EG classpath variables will become scoped per Java project, and the variable value
	will have to be taken from the PDE project that is being built.

NOTES:

dwd (6/12/2001 4:42:46 PM)

History stores are large because much of the space of index nodes is contained in keys that are
almost exactly alike.  The key/value data in the nodes could be compressed (using gzip) and split among 
several relatively small newly defined ""blob segment"" objects.  This way, the storage used by a history would
be dramatically reduced.

An API should also be defined limiting the size of a particular index.  An exception or status could be returned
if an insert is attempted that would cause an index to violate its limit.  A number of entries limit would be easy to 
enforce.  A byte limit would be harder."

PM (6/13/2001 9:46:56 AM)

JM (6/13/2001 7:42:01 AM)
	This problem would not be affected by ""recreating"" projects etc.  The issue is that the history store was corrupted
	by a bug in the old code.  The bug was fixed but there is no way of detecting the corruption etc.  So using pre
	122 workspaces with 122 code may well result in strange behaviour.  Unfortunate but unavoidable.

	may be loaded into the plugin registry.  This has happened to me while working on some
	SWT examples.  The latest build copy of the plugins was in dev\eclipse\plugins\..., and

	The differences between the two versions were:

		- one additional dependency

	It is the additional dependency that caused problems.  When trying to reference classes
	introduced into the plugin's runtime environment via the new dependency, the ClassLoader
	failed to find them - issuing a ClassDefNotFoundError.  Some other minor quirks as well
	in the data fetched from the PluginRegistry (the new dependency figured on both copies of
	the plugin, not just the second).

	Though this problem should never occur in practice, it may be helpful to add a couple lines
	to either:
		1) discard plugins with the same id and version as one already in the registry
		2) disambiguate seeming duplicates by appending an extra character to the version
		    number of those plugin id / version pairs that get registred twice so the
			assertions about there being only one plugin with a given id and version holds.

This is what I think is happening in more detail: 

Your index (named ""index"") contains entries of the form (key, objectID). You probably
create these something like this:

Index index = store.createIndex(""index"");
...
ObjectID id = store.createObject(bsob);
index.insert(key, id);
...


When you remove an index entry (perhaps you've hit a limit and are cleaning up the store)
you probably do something like:

IndexCursor cursor = index.open();
cursor.find(name);
cursor.remove();

what I think this should be is:

cursor.find(name);
id = cursor.getValueAsObjectID();
store.removeObject(id);
cursor.remove();

You could be getting the same effect if you are updating an index entry to point to a new object eg.

should be:

cursor.find(key);
ObjectID oldID = cursor.getValueAsObjectID();

Mainly, Jeff arguments do not take into accounts librairies whose licensing and

More, many well known Open Source librairies are build and install themselves as

While, in this case, one can always provide an Eclipse packaging, this will lead
to many sources for the same librairies, the worst case being having to install
the same version of a given library one for feature X, another from Y, and so on.

Let's assume for the moment that a scenario exists where a person wants to
deliver a plug-in that cannot, for whatever reason, contain a JAR it is
dependent on.  That is the ""if you don't"" scenario at the end of your comment.

Please help me understand how I can have my plug-in use ""regular Java-land
facilities"" such as adding new JARs to the classpath *without*:
  1. affecting the Eclipse startup commandline parameters, 
  2. writing my own classloader, or
  3. forcing the dependent JARs to be installed in the JVM's ""ext"" folder
Those are the limitations I think for most people requesting this
bug/enhancement be addressed.

I see a disconnect -- doing what I'm asking is not a ""regular Java-land
facility"" scenario.  Eclipse is an RCP *framework* -- it's not quite the same as
running the framework hosted app by itself from the command line.  Eclipse, in
my opinion, needs to be more flexible about allowing plug-ins to load classes
from other places on the filesystem.  

I'd hate to see this become a philisophical discussion.  A lot of solid,
real-world scenarios have been raised in these comments about cases where this
kind of support is necessary.

I am postulating that whatever mechanism you would use there is available to 
you when using Eclipse.

Question(s):  Assume you have plugin org.foo.P 1.2.4 and it lists
   $someplace$/p.jar
on its classpath.

- Who installed p.jar? (and when relative to installing P)
- How do you know that code in p.jar on your disk matches the 
expectations/published API of P 1.2.4? 
- How is P updated?  
- Who chooses $someplace$ and who sets the value?
- How does this play at development time (both for P and those who depend on P)
- How does this play at build time (is p.jar built by us?  Where is the source? 
Is it available for others to compile against?)
- More generally, what are the possible external visibilities of the code in 
p.jar?

Actually doing the change to enable this would be relatively trivial but 
finding good answers to these and the other questions is hard.

BTW, for the interested reader, look at EclipseClassLoader.findClassPathEntry
().  In there we substitution for $ws$, $os$ and $nl$ as well as constructing 
the dev mode classpath.  All of the above are considered to be relative to the 
plugin itself.  

You'll have to create a new kind of BundleFile to reference a file that is not 
part of a bundle but once that is in place, just add another case at the bottom 
to resolve your var to the appropriate BundleFile, create a ClasspathEntry, add 
it to the list and watch the classes load.

I would think most likely by either specifying them on the classpath of the VM
at startup time, installing them in the ""ext"" portion of the VM, or using one's
own class loader.  I realize that all of these options are probably available
with Eclipse, but I don't think they map well to what I thought this RFE was
requesting.

Eclipse is a ""multi-app"" (""plugins"") RCP framework, however, so I don't see
using the VM classpath as appropriate, putting things in the ""ext"" part of the
VM also seems inappropriate, and I'm still looking into how I could hook things
up via my own classloader.

The rest of your questions raise interesting issues, which of course have no
universal, easy answers, but let me take a stab at some context:

> Who installed p.jar? (and when relative to installing P)

Assume p.jar pre-existed on the filesystem before P was installed, similar to
say a p.jar installed as an ""ext"" extension to the VM.

> How do you know that code in p.jar on your disk matches the 
expectations/published API of P 1.2.4? 

The same way you know that the API of the VM or an extension installed in ""ext""
matches the expectations of P 1.2.4.  Ie. assume we don't expect Eclipse to
solve this problem.

> How is P updated?

Let's say the update manager.  p.jar is updated external to Eclipse.

> Who chooses $someplace$ and who sets the value?

Perhaps definable within the plugin.xml (for a fairly static environment), an
environment variable, or dynamically at plug-in start-up (for a more dynamic
environment).

> How does this play at development time (both for P and those who depend on P)

I believe Eclipse already allows a means for external JARs to be made available
at compilation time.  It's the runtime that seems more limited.

> How does this play at build time (is p.jar built by us?  Where is the source?
Is it available for others to compile against?)

Let's say that p.jar is not built by Eclipse, the source is not available, and
it is avaible (as .classes) for others to compile against.

> More generally, what are the possible external visibilities of the code in p.jar?

Unlimited.  p.jar exists as an entity outside the control of Eclipse.  Eclipse
gives up being the center of the universe as far as p.jar is concerned.

The lastest trends in the dicussion are of great interest because they are
basically related to the effort that should be made to make Eclipse as pervasive
as possible.
While all this discussion must be moved at some point into another more
appropriate place, i bet that people interested in this topic have a better
understanding of some issues to develop some ideas:

1/ Java Classpath vs Eclipse plugins
From the very beginning the classpath mechanism have been far from satisfactory,
especially on windows platforms.
The Eclipse plugin based framework is of great interest as a centralizing
mechanism: we can compare its advantages to the assembly concept for .NET which
is a huge improvement over the so-called DL-Hell.
But the outside world is both hostile and not very responsive to change, so
making the Eclipse a success leads to compromises, some of them being exposed in
this discussion.

2/ Making Eclipse attractive
While eradicating diversity in the distribution of Java components or
applications may require a lot of energy and time, it may be possible to make
the platform more attractive by considering a new project aimed at converting en
masse all the well known librairies used by the Java Community.
Consider the potential boost to the Eclipse community if all the Java librairies
from Apache and other famous Open Source be available as plugins from a central
repository.
I'm sure that all the legal issues can be overcomed and the community is ready
to contribute to the repository."

and when we restarted there was a problem.  DJ, do you remember more details?

	I believe that the scenerio was that a full_save on exit was interrupted (process 
	killed?) and never completed. This left an empty file where we were writing since 
	the stream was never closed. When the workspace is restored, the restore code
	tries to read an int to get the version number for the reader and it fails with an
	EOFException which is wrapped in a ResourceException. See SaveManager.restoreTree 
	for details. This is also applicable to restoring markers (MarkerManager.restoreFromSave)
	and syncinfo (Synchronizer.restoreFromSave)."

3076,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-11-20T22:56:48Z,2,0,"This is a really tricky area.  It stems from the fact that the Eclipse 
workspace is always case-sensitive, but the file-system may not be.  We have 
been unable to come up with a good solution for this that does not damage 
performance (I.e., we don't want to be scanning for case variants for operations 
that need to be quick, such as IResource#exists and IContainer#findMember).

What we've decided to try is this: we've introduced a new status code that 
indicates a local operation has failed due to the unexpected existence of a case 
variant on a case-insensitive filesystem.

So, in the case of this PR, IFolder#create will fail with the following status 
code:

IResourceStatus.CASE_VARIANT_EXISTS

This will allow the UI to handle this case gracefully.  In the case of import, 
presumably this means it will ignore the failure and continue with the import.

Moving to the UI team for consideration and implementation.  Let us know if this 
approach works for you...

move, and create when a collision occurs.  Currently (20020115 build) when you 
attempt to copy, move, or create and a name collision occurs, an error message 
is displayed and the operation is aborted.  Why should import silently continue 
when these other operations don't?  And even if we attempt to continue, I don't 
think we should do it silently (i.e., it should be left up to the user to decide  
what to do).  Why not just leave the behavior as is?  This is consistent with 
the rest of the workbench operations."
3076,lynne_kues@us.ibm.com,2002-01-28T21:43:48Z,7,0,"First of all, the CaseInvariant exception is not thrown on Linux and the import 
operation works (i.e., resources with the same name but different cases are 
supported).  

On WIN, if the CaseInvariant error occurs, import will still continue - just 
those files with the conflict will not be imported (and an error message at the 
end of the operation details this - though not as nicely as it could).

Let's say I wanted to try to ""silently handle"" it on Windows, I would have to do 
something weird to allow the operation to work (e.g., rename the resource folder 
I am unable to import to match the name of the resource folder it conflicts 
with so that the CaseInvariant error doesn't occur).  This doesn't seem like the 
right answer.  Or maybe when JA says ""silently handle"" he means don't show the 
error message at the end.  This isn't very user-friendly either (i.e., if you're 
doing a large import you may not realize some files didn't get imported due to a 
CaseVariant conflict).

So all I am going to try to do is improve the current error message.  Currently 
if you run into a folder conflict for a particular file, you get the following 
message:

""A resource exists with a different case <target folder name>.""

A better message would be:

""Unable to import <source file>: A resource exists with a different case <target 
folder name>.""

	KD got the same problem on his Linux machine. The stack trace is similar. The real problem is that
the user is unable to write its file because the history store is somehow not working (could not create
UUID). And it should not prevent the user from saving its file. In this case, history is just a superfluous
feature. Saving the file is the user's goal."

3083,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-25T21:55:52Z,3,0,"Fixed.  The solution was to avoid calling PluginDescriptor.isPluginActivated() 
from the sync block of the plugin class loader, in cases where activation is in 
progress.  Fix is in PluginClassLoader#findClassParentsSelf:

Old code:

if (descriptor.isPluginActivated() || pluginActivationInProgress) {

New code:

if (pluginActivationInProgress || descriptor.isPluginActivated()) {

Also added comments in Plugin constructor and startup(), strongly suggesting 
that sync blocks and other thread locking be avoided during plugin constructors 
and startup() methods.  Since there is one monitor already acquired in the 
plugin descriptor, it would only take one more monitor from client code to 
create a deadlock.  We believe this is unavoidable...

As a result, these tasks are not available to Ant support plugin users.  

NOTES:

JM(7/18/2001 7:00:16 PM)
	The immediate problem is easy to fix.  Include the require jar(s) in the Ant support plugin.

	This does not however solve the class lookup problem.  for example, the Junit task will 
	want to find various junit classes from the junit.jar (supplied separately).  The ant support 
	plugin has some rudimentary support for registering various classes in an extension point 
	and then tasks can indirect off the extension to load the actual class without requiring the 
	supplying plugin to be a prereq of the ant plugin.  Unfortunatlye, this requires changes to 
	the ant task (e.g., <junit>).

	I don;t know the real answer right now.  I suspect that for 1.0 the best we can do is solve 
	this with the other third party jar problems and let people spec the jars in the 
	java.exe -classpath arg (currently we drop that classpath and construct our own based on the 
	plugin.xmls).  This is not a great solution but it gets us running in the near term.

3085,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:49:11Z,0,0,"Summary of optimization changes:

Core Resources:

- changed tree lookups to call IPath.segment() instead of IPath.segments(), to 
avoid creating string arrays.
- DataTreeLookup objects now stored in a pool and dispensed via a factory 
method.  
	- Note: this currently relies on the assumption that there will never 
be more than 100 simultaneous tree readers.
		If there are > 100 readers doing a lookup at exactly the same 
time, they may get corrupted results (since the
		DataTreeLookup objects will start to be reused).  This seems to 
be a minimal risk, but the pool size could easily
		be bumped up if needed...
- created a specialized structure for storing the Node ID maps during delta 
computation.  Prevents the need to create
	instances of the Long class to use as keys.
- optimized ResourceDelta iteration to not create unnecessary ArrayList and 
Object[] instances during iteration.
- rearranged delta computation so that ResourceDelta tree is built first, and 
then moves are calculated and applied.
	This avoids needing to create the IPath objects to walk the tree, since 
the paths held onto by the ResourceDelta
	instances can be reused.
- optimized FileSystemResourceManager.locationFor to create less path objects.
- now passing the location as parameter to FileSystemResourceManager.write
(IFile, ...), which avoids having
to compute the location twice during file creation.
- added a singleton 8K buffer field to the FileSystemStore class, to avoid 
buffer creations for each call to transferStreams.
	The block that uses the buffer is synchronized, to prevent multiple 
concurrent writes from attempting to use the
	same buffer.  Since multiple concurrent writes are not currently 
supported anyway, this is just a safety measure.
- Refresh local: storing the location filesystem names in the UnifiedTree, to 
prevent having to recompute it in
	the refresh visitor.  This drastically reduces the number of String 
creations and OS calls during the refresh operation.
- optimized the Container.getFile and Container.getFolder methods to create 
less paths.
- Marker attributes are now stored in a specialized Map structure that is 
optimized for a small set of attributes, where
	the keys are interned Strings, so that lookup can use fast == for 
search and retrieval.
- Optimized the search for case variants during resource creation 
(Resource.findExistingResourceVariants).  Added
	a method to ElementTree to retrieve the names of child nodes without 
having to create path objects.  Drastically
	reduced the number of IPath creations during any operation that created 
resources.
- Removed code that was cloning the SyncInfo table each time more sync info was 
added.  This clone was unnecessary.
- Added a singleton ResourceStatus.OK.  Most operations were creating thousands 
of identical ResourceStatus instances
	that had OK severity.  Changed code throughout resources plugin to use 
this singleton whereever possible.
- Optimized ResourceInfo lookups (Workspace.getResourceInfo), to avoid throwing 
and catching exceptions whenever
	there was a false lookup.  Avoids the garbage and speed hit of creating 
exceptions and all the strings they contain.
- Removed superfluous Path creation in WorkspaceRoot.getProject.

Core Runtime:

- Reimplemented Path.java to be represented by an array of segments rather than 
a single string.

NOTES:

JohnA (8/27/2001 10:44:44 AM)
	Another round of optimizations that added small improvement to build 
times,
	and huge improvements to import and deletion times.  All timings after 
this
	point include the following extra optimizations:

	- Added code in CoreFileSystemLibrary to used the default platform 
encoding when converting
		strings to bytes for the getStat method. This avoided the 
creation of CharToByte conversion
		objects and byte[] objects.
	- MarkerManager.basicRemoveMarkers().  This method was opening a layer 
in the element tree
		even if there were no markers to remove.  Optimized so that 
tree only gets opened if there
		will actually be removals.  Big improvement to overall delete 
performance (>300%).
	- Optimized the Resource.countResources() method to avoid creating all 
the resources it was counting.
	- Added a hashmap to WorkspaceRoot that holds onto known project 
handles (keyed by name).  This was a big
		improvement because project handles were created quite often 
just to find out the project location.


JohnA (8/24/2001 1:29:17 PM)
	More performance results, this time for large imports and deletes.
	The sample set was a wad of eclipse source, 5621 files, 497 folders.

JohnA (8/27/2001 11:44:26 AM)
	Redid some of the build tests to find out effect of further 
optimizations.
	This is the same test as the build tests above, running on IBM JDK.
	Comparison is between HEAD (no optimizations), and all cumulative 
optimizations.

	contributed by fragments.

NOTES:

JM (7/26/2001 10:04:07 AM)
	Shouldn't getResourceBundle() use the same classpath as the normal plugin class loader?
	Actually it is unclear why we need a different class loader at all?  the current code limits us to 
	finding resource bundles only in the install dir of the plugin.  Bundles in jars and in library
	directories will not be found.

VK (7/26/01 10:20:44 AM)
	I think where we are right now is a statement of how we evolved. The code predates fragments
	and was there so workbench could get at translated plugin.properties, or any other resource
	bundle that was NOT part of the actual code .jar. None of our plugins specify <library name=""./""/>
	so the extra class loader was just a cheap way (in terms of coding) of getting the plugin.properties
	found and loaded. So the question is, what are the correct semantics to support? Some possible
	choices:
	(1)	use extra loader, make its classpath include plugin dir, and all detected fragment dirs. This
			would be ""morally equivalent"" to the current support. One would place plugin.properties
			files in the root of the plugin or fragment directory
	(2)	defer to the plugin loader to do the loading. This would require all plugins to specify
			<library name=""./""/> so the default plugin.properties are found.
	(3)	use extra loader as today, but parent it using the plugin loader (rather than null).
			This would preserve current behavior (ie. not have the downside of (2)), but if we fail
			would then do the regular search (fragment aware). The fragments would have a choice
			of specifying <library name=""./""/> and exposing the property file, or could just
			bundle it at a root of one of the supplied jars.
	Would need the <library name=""./""/> handling fixed (as file:, not jar:).
	I think I would vote for (3) ... 

VK (7/26/01 10:43:21 AM)
	On second thought, (3) would cause the parent loader to be searched first before going to the 
	base plugin directory, so this may not be what we want. So
	(4)	use extra loader, its classpath set to plugin directory + classpath of plugin loader

VK (7/26/01 11:09:33 AM)
	Have tried with option (3) as the fix and things seem to work. 

	Looking at the trace, option (3) causes the classloaders for ALL plugins that contribute to the UI to be created 
	as part of the workbench startup. This is because the workbench is looking for the plugin.properties strings
	and option (3) causes the plugin loaders to be created. This may be OK (not a heavy operation) but some of the 
	plugin loaders may never be actually used beyond this point. Also, when searching for the bundles, option (3)
	causes the prereq loader trees to be searched (search is guaranteed to fail for plugin.properties bundles)

VK (7/27/01 11:56:41 AM)
	Have done a few unscientific measurements using option (3) [the simplest fix]. All are done using the following configuration:
		slow machine: PII-266
		Win-NT
		launching self-hosted eclipse, base drop + example plugins
		running from jars (not dev mode)
		running with -debug, but only runtime tracing enabled (to get timings)
		2 perspectives open on startup (resource, scripting)

		Case 1: drop 0.127
												1			2			3			4			5			Average (ms)
			Startup complete:	24925	24936	24916	24956	24876		24922

		Case 2: drop 0.127 + change for option (3)

			Startup complete:	26088	26150	26138	26077	26098		26110

		So it would appear the startup cost of creating all the loaders that contrinuted UI elements, PLUS performing 
		longer lookup searches for the plugin.properties bundles is about 1 second on my slow machine. 
		This is with the base drop plus examples. In a large configuration we are likely to have 2-5 times as many plugins
		contributing to the UI so we would see corresponding increase in startup times.

VK (7/30/01 3:03:18 PM)
	Option (4) comes out marginally slower than current support ... basically not paying the performance cost of option (3).
	The conclusion is that the actual extra cost is not from creation of the loaders, but rather from the unnecessary
	searching down the prerequisite tree (always guaranteed to fail for the bundle, is multipled by Java locale-based
	qualified name search). 

VK (7/30/01 11:47:39 AM)
	Have created ""1GHOOPO: ITPCORE:WINNT - translated plugin.properties (R1.0 support)"" to track the R1.0 partial fix.

Markers

	Were you switching between J9 and JDK or something like this?  There is a fundamental problem with
	the J9 random number generator not generating the same sequence of numbers as the JDK version.
	As a result, the decryption of the keyring fails if the keyring was written with a different class lib.

DS (8/17/01 10:22:29 AM)
	I switch back and forth between JDK and J9 all the time.

JM (8/17/2001 12:06:56 PM)
	This is a known problem.  For now we can't do anything about it since it is actually a JCL problem that 
	cannot be fixed (they are not allowed to look at the Sun implementation to duplicate the sequence). 
	The workaround is to delete the .keyring file when you change between VMs.  In the furture we will 
	probably have our own random implementation.

	Moving to the 2.0 stream

JohnA (10/3/2001 5:28:02 PM)
	I have written an implementation of the SHA pseudo-random number generator (SHAPRNG).
	Despite the fancy name and overwhelming acronym, the implementation is trivial (two short methods).
	We can use this to maintain consistency across class libraries.  J9 doesn't seem to be available in
	current builds, so I'm waiting until it's possible to test the implementation.  We should also auto-delete
	the keyring file if there was a load failure, otherwise the user will have to delete it manually when we switch
	to the new algorithm.

the projects as isolated pieces as much as we can. This isolation could impact the way we
persist a project's metadata, since resources are already separate.
	This isolation would be linked to two more API's for IWorkspace:
		- import(InputStream project)
		- export(OutputStream project)
	Two suggested solutions:
	1) Separate the metadata on disk
	2) Separate on-the-fly when exporting

	It sounds good when the user wants to share projects but not necessarily create a version
of it on a VCM repository. Another advantage would be the possibility of exporting the local history
as well.

             PDE Error on Nature definition
        Date: 
             Tue, 14 Aug 2001 15:54:45 -0400
       From: 
             Pat McCarthy <patmc@us.ibm.com>
 Organization: 
             OTI-RTP - Eclipse Jumpstart Team
 Newsgroups: 
             eclipse.tools




I'm not sure this was reported before - I hope not (as it just spent a bit of time hitting the wall on this). 

(An aside - what will it take to get this newsgroup accessible from a dejanews/google search?  Then it would be
easy to find any related entries). 

The PDE support for a nature extension creates the following xml: 
<extension 
      id=""com.ibm.wsweducation.solution.resources.natures"" 
      name=""eduNature"" 
      point=""org.eclipse.core.resources.natures""> 
   <nature> 
      <runtime 
            class=""com.ibm.wsweducation.solution.resources.ProjectNature""> 
      </runtime> 
   </nature> 
</extension> 

This nature could never be added to a project description - a CoreException was thrown. 
I kept replacing my nature with the JavaNature defined as part of the JDT plugin - and my add nature logic would
work fine....  I finally saw why.  This is the xml for the JDT JavaNature extension: 
<extension 
         point=""org.eclipse.core.resources.natures"" 
         id=""javanature"" 
         name=""Java Nature""> 
         <runtime> 
              <run class=""org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaProject""> 
              </run> 
         </runtime> 
</extension> 

And no   <nature></nature> tags.  When I use the source view for the plug-in editor to fix my ProjectNature xml
definition (added <run></run> and removed <nature></nature>) - my nature works fine... 

Regards, 

Pat Mc. 


NOTES:

3106,jeffmcaffer@gmail.com,2001-10-11T02:49:32Z,0,0,"JW(8/20/2001 10:35:20 AM):
Using the latest IBM JDK (1.3.0 Service Release 9a cn130-20010609) from Hursley fails. You can't bring up the
workbench if there is a space somewhere in the path. For example, if Eclipse is in a directory
like  ""c:\some path with a space\eclipse"" it won't come up.

A little bit of debugging shows that in Main.getBootPath(String) this statement:

	url = getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation()

Returns a url with the spaces turned into ""%20"". For example, the above path
would become:

""c:\some%20path%20with%20a%20space\eclipse""

It then can't find anything because ""%20"" is not treated as a space but as
characters in the path and it can't find that path.

The same thing happens in InternalBootLoader.getInstallURL().

A workaround for now is to use the option:

   -boot ""c:\some path with a space\eclipse""

This then works and you can bring up Eclipse.

In Java 1.4_RC1 must create a URI, not a URL.

URI uri = new URI(url.toString());

Then can the listFiles found the Files in Pathes with %20.

The problem is, the URI exists first in 1.4
If any use the program with an older JVM, than have he the problem, 
which in the moment 1.4 has.

As workaround, i think, following should run:

...
File[] boots = new File(start).listFiles(filter);

If a file cannot even be *read*, this of course causes all kinds of Eclipse erorrs (build problems).

After the problem is fixed, say, with manipulations outside of Eclipse, a manual ""refresh"" on that particular file does not remove the errors. Eclipse simply refuses to try building again. The user says: ""Please reconsider this file."", Eclipse says: ""Nay, I won't do that.""

The only known workaround is a ""clean"" (i.e., rebuild) the entire project.

So, by merging the writeable issue with the readable issue, this bug has become a more serious issue than it had been for several years.

The original ""I cannot write the file"" has been alleviated for most practical uses, by:

3. Run the first script: you get the error.



NOTES:

FB (24/08/2001 2:13:47 PM)

The EclipseAnt class, which is the one called for the ""ant"" task, creates a ""Project"" project while initializing itself. It sets the properties of the calling project to this new project.
That means that if you have put somewhere ""initTemplate"" in the first Ant script, then it works.
Try the following example that works:

<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<project name=""test"" basedir=""C:\temp"" default=""Ant"">
  <target name=""Fake"">
    <initTemplate/>
  </target>
  <target name=""Ant"">
	<ant antfile=""InitTemplate.xml"" dir=""D:\Eclipse_self-hosting\0.132\eclipse\workspace\Ant-Task-Tests""/>
  </target>
</project>

When the EclipseProject is created for this script, the taskdef for ""initTemplate"" is added to the taskdef list of the project. (cf. EclipseProject#createTask). Therefore, 
when the ""ant"" task creates a ""Project"" project and sets the properties of the calling project to this project, the definition of ""initTemplate"" is passed, and there is no error.

** So the problem comes from the fact that when creating a task, an EclipseProject knows that it has to look into the AntPlugin task extensions list to find the class that 
** corresponds to a given task name, but a basic Apache Project does not know how to do that.
** Or, the ""ant"" task creates an Apache Project.

internally).  These new find methods will not cause the plugin to be 
activated.  Note that the find methods in Plugin have now been changed to use 
the ones in IPluginDescriptor/PluginDescriptor.  

The URL returned from find (in Plugin/IPluginDescriptor/PluginDescriptor) is no 
longer a platform URL but a 'real' URL that does not need to be processed 
through Platform.resolve().  Processing through Platform.resolve() will just 
cause the same URL to be returned.

The decision to return non-platform URLs was made because in the Plugin.find 
code, a non-platform URL was returned if the thing being looked for was in a 
fragment directory and a platform URL was returned if it was found in a plugin 
directory.  For consistency, non-platform URLs will be returned in all cases.  
Fragments do not currently support platform URLs.

Another minor change - this code would look in the option root directory but 
not in the fragment or plugin root directory.  Now, if a $<option>$ is 
specified, the option root directory will not be searched but the root of the 
plugin and any fragments will.  For example:  if you were looking for 
$nl$/plugin.properties and your default locale was en_CA the old code would 
have searched the following directories:
<plugin root>/nl/en/CA
<fragment1 root>/nl/en/CA
<fragment2 root>/nl/en/CA
...
<plugin root>/nl/en
<fragment1 root>/nl/en
<fragment2 root>/nl/en
...
<plugin root>/nl
<fragment1 root>/nl
<fragment2 root>/nl
...
The new code will search the following directories:
<plugin root>/nl/en/CA
<fragment1 root>/nl/en/CA
<fragment2 root>/nl/en/CA
...
<plugin root>/nl/en
<fragment1 root>/nl/en
<fragment2 root>/nl/en

<plugin root>
<fragment1 root>

There is a glitch in the current support ... Jeff has a core PR to address
this in 2.0 ... 1GHOZI1: ITPCORE:WINNT - Strings contributed by
fragment.xml cannot be translated.

We can get away with this in 1.0 the way we use fragments for nl, because
the fragment.xml strings are not really used in our UI. Would be a problem
if the fragment contributed an extension, but this is a low-probability
scenario at this point. Need to fix in 2.0. A partial solution would be to
add new keys to the plugin.properties nl variant, but this does not allow
adding a default (from nl point of view) version of the string (ref. your
prior question about the default plugin.properties).


Follow up dumb: How do you externalize the plugin name of the
fragment itself ?


Good question ... had to look at the code to see how things got loaded.

If you include plugin.properties directly in the fragment directory it is
never looked at. If you include it in the root of the jar contributed by
the fragment then the plugin.properties in the base plugin wins.

So the answer is the base plugin always wins.


Is the fragment allowed to have a plugin.properties.

I realize it has the en, jp ones etc - but I was wondering if it had a
plugin.properties if thus would cause confusion as to
whether this one wins or the one in the main plugin

Last Friday, when I was trying to view source for the jre classes (not
being able to set JRE_SRC at the time), I tried a bunch of things which
included putting a symlink to /home in my project directory.

When I removed the project I was testing with, it asked me if I wanted to
remove the files in the project directory (you can probably guess what's coming
next).  It descended into my home directory and started to remove all of
the files it could that I owned (it removed my cvs repository among other
things).  Luckily, this is a fairly new installation and I didn't have
much in /home that I couldn't restore!

To prevent this behavior, I would suggest using getCanonicalPath() on
each directory before descending into it, to verify that the current
directory is actually the candidate's parent.

3120,dejan@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T02:49:46Z,0,0,"When asking PDE plug-in for its state location while testing it on Linux, I 
received a bad
result. This is the situation:

Home: /home.eclipse3/dejan/sdk134/eclipse

Workspace: /home.eclipse3/dejan/sdk134/ws

Resulting location:

/home.eclipse3/dejan/sdk134/eclipse/""/home.eclipse3/dejan/sdk134/ws""/.metadata/.
plugins/org.eclipse.pde

The resulting location is strange because it looks like it has merged both the 
home and the workspace. It
is also strange because it has quotes in the middle of the location. 

Does this looks normal? For some reason, when I create a file by appending a 
file name to this location,
it seems to work. However, if I bracket the file name in quotes (for cases 
where home location has
spaces in it a.k.a ""Program Files/..."", the resulting string has embedded quotes

	This does not seem normal at all.  
	I am assuming that your situation is somehow different then all the 
other situations because
	people like JDT should be doing the same thing and not having any 
problems...
	Please include all the informatoin you have (e.g., code you use to get 
this result) 
	and we'll investigate.

DG (9/6/2001 3:11:46 PM)
	Actually, I am not doing anything fancy at all. I need to create a tmp. 
file in my state
	location, so I ask for it and append the file name. The code is fairly 
simple and works well
	on Windows:


private String createPluginPath(String eclipseDir) {
	IPath stateLocation = PDEPlugin.getDefault().getStateLocation();

	File file = stateLocation.append(""pde_plugin_path.properties"").toFile();

	String fileName = file.getAbsolutePath();
	
	try {
		OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(file);
		PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(stream);
		String projectPath = Platform.getLocation().toOSString();
		addExternalModels(writer, eclipseDir);
		addWorkspaceModels(writer);
		writer.flush();
		writer.close();
	} catch (IOException e) {
		return null;
	}

	String option = ""-plugins \"""" + fileName + ""\"""";
	return option;

   Specifically the specification states in section 10.3:

There is a thread on the newsgroup about this, and it seems pretty clear from 
this bug report that this is not easy to solve at its root.  

Perhaps as a workaround, core.resources could provide a ""Recover Projects"" 
facility that would read an old workspace's .projects directory and rebuild 
those projects in the new workspace.  They would still lose other metadata, but 
most people can probably live with resetting preferences.  This is an 
alternative to ""File-->Import-->Existing Project"" many times. 

Obviously a better solution would be for each plugin to have the ability to 
recover what metadata it can from another workspace, but that is well beyond 
the scope of this bug.

for the user if he happens to stumble upon an OOM error (which seem to be the
most common cause of workspace corruptions, based on the bug reports listed above).

1) Making shutdown as tight as possible, not requiring persisting of so much
critical data. I don't know the internals, but perhaps more of the info can be
persisted ""as you go"" instead of waiting for workbench shutdown. Possibly in the
background. The goal should be to get shutdown as small as possible, so VM
failure at that point is not so tragic.

2) A fallback to ""last known good"" configuration (as has been discussed in this
and other bugs) could be implemented in Eclipse startup. The process to recover
a workspace that has bad .tree and/or .snap files is pretty simple to fix
without losing a lot of data, but it should be built in as much as possible.

3) In lieu of the above, a little more helpful logging pointing to the exact
file(s) that are corrupt is needed, as well as some prominent documentation
about how to recover from a corrupt workspace. It should not be so difficult for
users to learn what to do to get back to work."

- run the finally block
- removes 1.tree
- writes master table which has reference to 2.tree

So on startup we read the master table, it tells us to read 2.tree and then we 
blow up. Ouch.

We need to refactor the code so if we have a failure when saving, we do not 
delete any files. We should ensure that all the old files are there so we can 
at least try to use them to bring the platform up.

Cleanup code has been moved out of the finally block.  This means cleanup of
unused files will not happen on abormal save termination, so the valid tree file
will not be deleted.  Also moved the code to commit the master table immediately
after writing the tree, otherwise an error between those operations would result
in a master table pointing to the wrong tree. 

Here is the revised timeline from DJ's comment:

- start saving workspace tree (1.tree is ok and on disk, we are saving 2.tree)
- get an exception saving 2.tree so this file is now only half there
- abort the save immediately

Now, the master table still has a reference to 1.tree, and we have 1.tree and
2.tree on disk.  On next startup, 1.tree will be read, and on next shutdown,
2.tree will be overwritten with the next valid save state.

We have someone here who is moving a large number of projects from VAME to
Eclipse. We're talking about over 150 projects which are loaded into the
workspace at one time. Note that this is actually a normal configuration for
the type of work this person does. Having moved these projects, we are now
seeing a performance issue we don't quite understand.
Every time a file is changed, a progress dialog appears with an updating
message which says ""Reading resource change information"" followed by the
names of all the projects in the workspace. This dialog lasts about 20-30
seconds. Now if we were changing java source and there were numerous
interrelated projects I could understand, but that does not appear to be the
case.

For example, we created a brand new java project which has no references to
any of the other 150+ projects (nor do the other projects reference this new
one). We then created an .xml file in this project and opened it in an
editor. Everytime we save the .xml file, we see the progress dialog racing
through all the other projects in the workspace. Why is this? None of those
projects should be affected by this project, and certainly not by a change
to an .xml file.

Then Philippe said:

The ""Reading resource change information"" message indicates the Java
builder is asking the platform for the delta computations. 

When the build button is pressed, all Java projects are traversed to see
if they need to be rebuild based on the changes in them and the changes in
their prerequisites. Note that a change inside a resource file on the
classpath still need the Java builder to copy it into the binary output
location.


NOTES:

JohnA (10/5/2001 5:20:45 PM)
	A massive improvement here could be accomplished as follows:

		- find out the set of projects that have changed
		- for each builder, if any of its ""interesting projects"" have changed, invoke builder

	This would mean we don't even have to invoke the builder if we know it won't
	be interested in any changes."
3137,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-10-15T16:48:58Z,1,0,"Fixed.  Summary of changes (all in BuildManager and ResourceDeltaFactory:

- not eagerly opening the tree for builds (means less tree layers)
- Before invoking a builder, compute dtree delta since last build and see if 
there are any changes to project this builder cares about.  If not, the builder 
is not invoked
- When builder requests a delta, see if that project has changed (by looking at 
dtree delta computed above), and return an empty delta if not changed (saves 
building a ResourceDelta naively).
- Cache the last ResourceDelta requested by a builder.  If the old and new trees 
haven't changed since last request, just return the cached copy.  The cache

	there exists dir 'a' and a subdir 'Copy Of s'

	i call findMember(""Copy of s"") on a and get null (note the different case in 'Of')
	ok, it doesn't exist so i can create it - but then i get an exception saying that it does exist already.

	i think, it should either be 'ignore case everywhere in resource names' or 'never ignore case'.

	in the ui land - i have no way to tell that the copy call will fail.
	i check if the resource exists - and it supposedly doesn't.

JohnA (10/9/2001 10:25:40 AM)
	The problem is that Eclipse is always case-sensitive, and your filesystem isn't.  It's really
	difficult to be consistent here, considering we support case-sensitive and insensitive filesystems.
	You can check the return status from the copy call to see why it failed... It seems acceptable
	to allow the user to try it, and then the error message should explain why it failed.

AK (10/10/2001 12:53:05 PM)
	then i think findMember should be filesystem-aware.
	or core should provide another, filesystem-aware, routine to verify the file name

3140,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-11-20T23:03:46Z,2,0,"This is a really tricky area.  We have been unable to come up with a good 
solution for this that does not damage performance (I.e., we don't want to be 
scanning for case variants for operations that need to be quick, such as 
IResource#exists and IContainer#findMember).

What we've decided to try is this: we've introduced a new status code that 
indicates a local operation has failed due to the unexpected existence of a case 
variant on a case-insensitive filesystem.

So, create, copy and move calls will continue to fail when a case variant is 
detected, but the following status code will be in the exception:

IResourceStatus.CASE_VARIANT_EXISTS

This will allow clients to handle the case more consistently and gracefully.  We 
know it's not ideal, because you can't quickly test for this as the user types a 
name.  My reasoning is that this case is rare enough that this solution will be 
acceptable.  The user will just get a message saying a conflicting file has been 
found, and they'll quickly understand how they can work around it.

Thanks Vlad, that's good news.  I believe it is reasonable to have software
updates installable only by someone with root authority.  Theoretically it
should be possible to have Help > Software Update work, but prompt the user for
the root password for proper authentication.  I've seen this done when you use
RPM and aren't logged in as root.

	The danger is that we have other cases where:

		allow the installation of configA to a newer version, thereby  upgrading the child component.

LC (6/6/01 3:50:18 PM)
i started putting in the fix when i realize that i have opened a can of worms - when adding a product,
we do similar processing where we find all the components that match its compEntries we do that
in both addProductDescriptorToLocal() and _loadManifest() - currently we match for exact version, 
but should probably do a fuzzy search too.  
This assumes that when adding the product, we check that the comp already installed adheres to the 
rules applied to the product's corresponding compEntry.  We know that this is not working right now -
 i can install a component at v3.0.0 and then later try adding a configuration that only contains the 
component at v1.0.0 and it will allow me to install the configuration.

When I select no, don't overwrite, I get a message asking whether I want to 
load the changes from disk. When I select yes, the editor buffer is replaced 
with a truncated file.
The local history is empty at this point, the old file contents is gone! So the 
current behavior is worse than what I originally PRd.

It should be possible to keep the old file contents if the save fails or at 
least keep a local history of the last state in this scenario. Saving files 
should be made ""more"" fail safe."

AbstractTextEditor is handling the CoreException and infering it occurred 
because the file was out of sync (producing the wrong message). Shouldn't it 
test the status object error code to see if it is a 
IResourceStatus.OUT_OF_SYNC_LOCAL instead?

From the point of view of serviceability, I believe Core is doing the right

3328,eclipse@abstratt.com,2003-03-06T15:13:10Z,12,0,"We can have so two situations where an out-of-disk-space IOException may arise 
when saving a file (IFile#setContents) in a full (or near to full) disk.

1) when the currently saved state of the file is copied to the local history 
(may fail expanding the index, or writing the contents) - no exceptions will be 
raised, only logged, and the saving process will go on - this is good; 

2) when the current contents in the editor will replace the existing ones. This 
may not fail because the new content length can be smaller than the saved one.

When ""1"" happens, data loss shouldn't occur - only new states could not be 
added. I could reproduce a case where the last state was lost - and this is a 
bug.

When ""2"" happens, a proper exception is thrown by IFile#setContents to clients. 
The problem Knut faced (previous state restoration) is a result of the 
mishandling of the exception by AbstractTextEditor (which allows the user to 
load the corrupted state from disk).

Unfortunately, according to bug 32765 comment 1, AbstractTextEditor blinded 
handling of CoreExceptions is not going to be fixed.

3328,eclipse@abstratt.com,2003-04-07T15:02:55Z,13,0,"Actually, the behaviour I was observing was correct: the last saved state 
couldn't be added to the history store (there is no disk space), and that 
state was lost. But neither the previous states, nor the current one, were 
lost.

In comment 7, it seems that there were previously saved states in the local 
history that aren't there anymore. Is that true, Knut? Do you have steps to 
reproduce it (I can't)? Thanks."

3328,daniel_megert@ch.ibm.com,2010-08-02T10:35:40Z,17,0,"This is not fixed (3.6 and N20100729-2000): org.eclipse.core.resources.IFile.setContents(InputStream, boolean, boolean, IProgressMonitor) throws an exception to report the 'out of disk' condition but at that time it has already already corrupted the file (file is empty).

Note that the editor correctly tells this to the user but as just said, the file is already gone at that point, which in my opinion should not happen: the API should not touch/corrupt the file if there's not enough space.

To make things worse, the history mechanism does not report the CoreException and just logs an error if it cannot save itself due to out of disk space. In my test scenarios this lead to a state where I was still able to save the file without any feedback in the UI (since no exception) but storing the local history already failed with log entries like this:

Editor can't do it either. Even if it did it would be at the wrong layer.
moving Platform-Core"
3551,john.arthorne@gmail.com,2001-11-13T20:24:25Z,4,0,"I don't see the special case here.  The following are equivalent from core's 
perspective:

- modify a file in an internal eclipse editor, save
- modify in external editor, save, refresh local

Both of these sequences yield a delta describing that the file has changed.  In 
neither case has a marker been changed.

Core doesn't interpret the values of marker attributes.  I think what you're 
suggesting is that core should, for every changed file, walk over the markers 
for that file and update the line and character position attributes.  Core 
doesn't have the knowledge or the responsibility to do this.  We can't infer 
what lines have been modified in the file, and so can't update marker attributes 
accordingly.  Even if we could, it would be out of place for Core to modify the 
attributes of markers it didn't create.

I don't think anything can be done here.
"
3551,dirk_baeumer@ch.ibm.com,2001-11-14T07:47:41Z,5,0,"I agree that Core can't update the markers if we change the file using an 
external editor. But the problem also shows up if we change a file using the 
core infrastructure directly. Consider the followingh case:

Java Core changes a file using JDOM. Doing so invalidates all markers since 
marker updating is currently done by the text infrastructure which lives in the 
UI land.

Since Core introduces the concept of Markers and Files, Core should be 
responsible to keep them in sync when changing the file or marker is done 
through the Core infrastructure. Otherwise everybody who is using Core files is 
in the business to update markers when he changes the content of a file. 

I already discussed this issue with Jeem and he agreed that this is core 
responsibility."
3551,jeem@moths.ca,2001-11-19T16:03:02Z,6,0,"Core's notion of markers includes standard attributes for a
character range (IMarker.CHAR_START and CHAR_END) and a line number
(LINE_NUMBER). Core could provide the essential infrastructure for
adjusting markers when the marked file is changed by a client that
can describe how the file's contents were edited. The onus would be
entirely on the client to request that markers for a resource 
be updated, and provide the information that allows such adjustments
to be made

The proposed core infrastructure is an operation that adjusts markers
on a particular file resource according to a client-supplied edit 
description capable of describing a batch of non-overlapping changes.
E.g., an edit description might contain
   1. replace character range [0,100) with 10 characters
   2. replace character range [200,300) with 0 characters (i.e., a deletion)
   3. replace character range [400,400) with 20 characters (i.e., an insertion)
The source ranges are in terms of the original contents of the file, and
can be applied in any order. This info is sufficient to determine whether
a marker at a given character range should be moved, expanded/truncated,
or deleted outright. Although this calculation is straightforward and could
be done by any client that edits a file, having the operation in core
would make it simpler for all clients to get this common thing done right.
"

under the current API.

Is updating CHAR_START and CHAR_END sufficient, or is LINE_NUMBER needed as 
well?  The character positions could be updated quickly given the information 
Jeem describes, but updating the line numbers is trickier.  If the characters 
from 200->400 have been deleted, core can't compute how many line separators 
have been removed, and so cannot update the LINE_NUMBER correctly."

3551,kai-uwe_maetzel@ch.ibm.com,2001-11-28T16:06:34Z,9,0,"Updating positions seems simple only at the first glance. Having user defined 
marker types, it is also part of the marker type definition how the marker 
positions are updated. Assume a marker at [100, 150. Now assume an insert at 
100. What happens to the marker? Is the marker moved or expanded? Well, you 
can't answer. It depends on the marker type. Even worse, the updating of marker 
positions might depend on the concrete changes, e.g., what was the content of 
the text that has been deleted. The list of these issues can grow rather long. 
Bottom line is that the core can not define the semantics of marker position 
updating but must be open for custom made solutions.

In addition, marker position updating is good to have. However, the problems 
are the same for potentially any marker property.  "

this is the right way to go anyway since:

		- the precondintion checking takes the longest amount of time.
		- the actual change shouldn't be cancelable anyway since the 
program can end up in an inconsistent state. Furthermore it is not
		  possible to generate an undo object for an canceled 
refactoring.

	Not fully true. Precondition checking is only cancelable when pressing 
Next on the first page. When pressing Finish the whole
	operation isn't cancelable at all.

	There are different solutions for that problem:
	
	a.) we post every change to a document into the UI thread. This enables 
to run the operation in a different thread and makes it
	     cancelable.
	b.) the document / document provider or the listener fixes the problem. 
But then JFace Text is the only component that deals with
	     multi thread issues.
	c.) Java Core improves IBuffer in a way that it reports more fine 
grained changes. This would enable the document to keep markers
	     for non changed text segements. If we do that, the Refactoring 
Core could use IBuffer from Java Core to do their text changes instead

3970,matthew@mxtelecom.com,2004-05-07T02:39:58Z,28,0,"WORKAROUND

This is a hideous hack, but it seems to provide a crass workaround for my 
specific problem.  On looking at the source, it appears that Eclipse uses 
System.getProperty(""line.separator"") for *all* line termination logic - both 
for doing CVS diffs, creating new files, etc.  So to make Windows Eclipse 
workspaces compatible with *nix commandline tools (e.g. when accessing a unix-
hosted workspace over samba), all one has to do is to override Eclipse's JVM's 
line.separator System property to be just LF.  All my Windows tools which work 
on the workspace are happy with UNIX line endings (e.g. javac, text editors), 
with the possible exception of TortoiseCVS - which Eclipse obviously supplants 
when manipulating the workspace anyway.

To override system properties for a JVM, one would typically pass in -
Dline.separator=<LF> at the commandline.  Apologies if there's a better way of 
specifying properties for Eclipse's JVM than this; I couldn't see any 
in 'Running Eclipse' in Help.  The problem arises in how to express LF (0x0a) 
in the commandline - under the NT CMD and batch files I see no obvious way to 
escape the 0x0a character, likewise in the Eclipse shortcut editing properties 
dialog.  So instead I've used the win32 IShellLink Interface as wrapped by 
Win32::Shortcut in Perl to manually insert the appropriate commandline args in 
the Eclipse shortcut file:

#!c:\perl\bin\perl

use Win32::Shortcut;

my $l = new Win32::Shortcut;

$l->Load('c:\Documents and Settings\Matthew Hodgson\Start 
Menu\Programs\Programming\Eclipse 3.lnk');
$l->Arguments('-vmargs -Dline.separator='.chr(10).' -Xmx640M');
$l->Save();


for my particular case. And this appears so far to work and solve all my line 
termination problems.  Apologies if this is obvious to everyone else, or a 
truly horrible way of passing in binary system properties :)"

I've now been using this hack for the last 2 months, and had a reasonably close
look at all the places where the linesep property is references, and have had
absolutely no problems with it.  It obviously does have effects outside of the
editor - but desired ones (e.g. stopping CVS from munging line delimeters). 
It's good enough for me, at any rate ;)

It would be obviously be deeply desirable to not have to do this, however.  And
manually having to ""Edit > Convert line delimiters"" on every NT-originated file
is simply not an option for me, at any rate."

the Shortcut Properties dialog box.  Unsure why I missed that the first time
round - thanks Oski :)

I agree with Brian that it's possible that other plugins & code running in the

however I can confirm that CDT, Lomboz, the Sysdeo Tomcat Plugin & the cloudsoft
memory manager plugins all work fine (to date) with it."

I've used SciTE (www.scintilla.org) editor in LF mode to copy-n-paste the LF

handling Unix line-breaks can be used).

I've noticed some small odd behaviours on my Eclipse 3.0 just after that change:
Eclipse has not recognized my previous (CR+LF) workspace configuration file,
with an error message on startup. Solution: simply re-configure the workspace:
current perspective, added projects etc.

In addition, the configurations already made on Lomboz plugin (basically paths
for JDK and J2EE servers) was not correctly recognized, although the paths was
correctly listed on Window > Preferences > Lomboz. Solution: just re-write those
paths on Preferences dialog and re-apply.

Conclusion: the workaround is too tricky, please seriously consider implement
this feature in a future Eclipse release."

Well, our reasons are the same as for others: Different platforms for
development but one target platform for production. The borderline is marked by
the source control management system. If the IDE does not provide the
possibility to set the appropriate line delimiter at file creation time - what
currently is not the case - one has to convert line delimiters later in the
process - at the latest before committing into the SCM. This produces several
kinds of work and overhead for every unit using Eclipse which could be easily
avoided if there was that possibility to set the preferred line delimiter within
the GUI.

Of course there will not be comments of all of our developers - they actually
have to do their work. I hope I can get some of them to vote for this bug anyway.

Our job is to write the code we write; not fix obvious problems in an open-

recognize that this issue is currently causing you grief. I'm going to discuss this with the developers 
and I will annotate this PR with a better description of the current situation by the end this week.

In the mean time here are some things to keep in mind:

1) This really is an enhancement request, not a bug. There are many, many Eclipse (and Eclipse based 
commercial product) users that do not need this feature. You're use case is *very* real, but it does not 
impact the vast majority of people who use Eclipse.

2) Architecturally, this is not a simple enhancement for Eclipse to make. If it was, it just outright WOULD 
have been implented by now. Man, for something that seems so obvious, line termination is 
unbelievably pervasive and subtle. As has already been noted, both operating systems and VCM 
systems typically want to control line terminaters, but there are other factors. Are the rules different for 
specific ""kinds"" of text files? At what granularity do we allow these to be set? Where is the information 
stored? Even just ""What *is* a text file?"" isn't an easy question to answer.

In any case, as I said above, I'll get back to you with more info once I have it. In the mean time, if you're 
going to flame me, *please* remember to be civil while you're doing it.
"
3970,christopher.todd@titan.com,2005-04-26T22:17:48Z,58,0,"To hopefully end the back-and-forth.. I do apologize for my perhaps harsh tone 
in the last comment.. I really, really -want- to use Eclipse. I think a lot of 
people do who have commented about this issue, and I don't think I'm alone in 
*feeling* that the issue has been ignored up until now. Three and a half years 
seems a long time for such a thing to be outstanding.

It also puts someone between a rock and a hard place when one touts the 
benefits of such a project to your peers and superiors, and such a (ok, 
seemingly) minor issue throws a wrench in the works.  We all hear about the 
revolution OSS is to bring; I wasn't flaming anyone in particular -- just the 
attitude I see way too often.. ""Got an issue? Fix it yourself or shut up."" The 
last comment about the guy with 50 developers really got to me.. If I had the 
time and resources to dedicate to fixing such things, I would. I don't. 
Eclipse isn't only the right tool for the price, it's usually the right tool 
period - and this problem was being ignored. It forced me to use lower 
quality, more expensive tools because this was such a block to productivity. 
It's not about me being cheap and expecting something for nothing.. Just 
expecting more than a couple years of silence when multiple people express the 
same concern.

Anyways, I won't digress and derail this any further. I didn't mean to get 
vitriolic -- it just seemed our complaints were falling on deaf ears for too 
long. If this issue is being addressed, tremendous.  

I am clearly not alone in needing this feature. Albeit, I may have been more 
vocal -- but this issue needed to be addressed. I think some may be 
underestimating the number of users who work on disparate platforms; I also 
think the number of people with such a need is more likely to increase in 
time, versus decrease. 

That being said -- re: technical subtleties of the issue..  Since it's 
possible to select this on a *per-file* basis, would it not be possible to 
simply have the option to make that ""stick"" as a default; and therefore any 
file edited would be treated with the correct delimiters, just as if the user 
had manually selected it on file open?  I know that may not be the most robust 
solution, but it may help a lot of us get on with work and not have to be so 
concerned about the problem until a more robust solution can be implemented.

I will remain in the peanut gallery from now on; however I am glad to hear the 
issue is being considered. I think that's what we all wanted to hear."

I want to apologize for my impolite tone. From reading the comments it seemed to
me that the problem was simply ignored for a very long period of time. But after
the comment #57 From McQ saying that the issue is being considered with all its
difficulties I have nothing to ask or to add anymore and will stay silent and
patient. I did not think or say that this was a simple-to-fix issue at all. And
as I said, we started development with Java only months ago, so most of the
developers are still beginners. But - even if one of the more experienced could
do it - I'm not their boss, so I can't tell them what to do. I could try to
convince the boss that it would be worth the time and effort - you know, how
difficult that is. Sorry again. I should have voted and kept my comment under my
hat."

little bit: for 3.1 the line delimiter conversion has been improved to work over
several files, folders and even projects (File > Convert Line Delimiters To)."
3970,Mike_Wilson@ca.ibm.com,2005-04-29T20:15:41Z,61,0,"Ok. I've talked to most of the teams that are potentially effected by this, and here's what I found...

In the current Eclipse R3.1 development builds the following support for custom line separators already 
exists [yes, you probably know this already]:

1) When opened on an existing text file that contains line separators, the standard Eclipse editors 
detect which line separator the file uses, and continue to use that one as new lines are added. This 
should prevent ""mixed"" line separators from appearing in files.

2) The CVS repository provider (i.e. the Eclipse code we wrote to talk to CVS) has a preference checkbox 
""Convert text files to use platform line ending"", which can be found in the ""Files and Folders"" tab of the 
""CVS"" preference page (under the ""Team"" preference page). By default this preference is checked, but if 
you *uncheck* it, CVS will not modify the line separators of text files when they are checked out of (or 
into) CVS. This, together with point 1), should allow a team with developers working on multiple 
platforms to work with existing text files without causing the line separator to be modified.

3) As Dani mentioned above, the ""File"" > ""Convert Line Delimiters To"" menu operation can now be 
applied to whatever is selected, be they files, folders or projects. This should allow wholesale 
conversion of existing text files without grief.

Honestly, I think this already a pretty good story, but none of it actually addresses the feature 
requested by this bug: ""UI needed to define the default line delimiters for new files"". So here's what 
we're going to do [To be clear, THESE FEATURES ARE NOT YET IN]:

1) We'll provide a per-project preference that allows you to choose what you want the default line 
separator to be for new text files created in that project. By putting it on the project, the value will be 
shared with the project. This, together with the features described above, lets a team of developers 
working on the shame project always use a particular line separator both when editing existing files 
and creating new ones.

2) We'll provide the same kind of preference for the workspace as a whole. This will be used for projects 
that do not explicitly have the preference set. Note that, if you want the line separator setting to ""stick"" 
to your work, you will want to use the project setting rather than this one (because even if you weren't 
sharing the project, you would have to remember re-set it every time you got a new workspace).

3) We'll modify the standard places where text files are created to detect and use these properties. One 
*very* important thing to keep in mind about this is that, we don't have control over all of the text file 
creating tools that have been written by the Eclipse community. Some of these, by nature of how they 
fit into the underlying frameworks, may do the right thing with the new preferences, some probably 
won't. I presume you will take on the task of evangelizing the need to support this new capability with 
the authors of the plugins you care about. ;-)

So... the intent is to get this in before R3.1 ships. Because we are so close to the end of the cycle -- our 
M7 milestone, which is our first release candidate, is in two weeks -- I'm still pretty worried that we 
won't get all of the cases right, so it will be important for you to do serious testing once we do get the 
code in. I can't even promise that the code will be in for M7; it may slip past it by a week or so, so you'll 
have to watch for it."

1. We can stop showing dirty indicators on parents.  To find out if you have 
projects with changes, you'ld need to perform a query.  This has certain 
performance gains as well since you don't have to check the dirty status for 
all elements of a project (expensive and doesn't scale as projects increase in 
size).

2. Something else which understands the logical parenting in the packages 
view.  All we have here is the problem description; we have no solution to 
propose as yet, but at least have time to think about it now.  This is the 
deluxe solution although it doesn't avoid the performance issue cited above."

However it is subclassed in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.BreakpointRulerAction.  Additionally, it appears that
MarkerRulerAction defines some useful base functionality so that it is possible to get a working breakpoint ruler
action for a simple language plugin just by overriding addMarker.

SUGGESTED CHANGES:
One of the following:
1. Revise the API documentation to describe MarkerRulerAction as subclassable
2. Refactor MarkerRulerAction into AbstractMarkerRulerAction, leaving out addMarker to be defined by subclasses.
Make a new MarkerRulerAction as a subclass of AbstractMarkerRulerAction.  Document AbstractMarkerRulerAction
as subclassable but MarkerRulerAction as non-subclassable.

I am having a problem with adding an editor action to the Ruler popup menu.

Once my action is called I want call
  textEditor.getVerticalRuler().getLineOfLastMouseButtonActivity(); 

but getVerticalRuler() is a protected method of AbstractTextEditor.

Is there some other way to get the line in the ruler area that the popup
originated from?

-----------------------------------------------------------

> Is this for an editor of your own devising, or for an arbitrary editor?

The action is being added to an arbitrary editor.  (Any editor that
supports the targetID=\""#TextRulerContext\"")


> A better solution would be to pass the ruler to the actions which need it.
> AbstractTextEditor, and certain subclasses like the Java editor do this.
> They pass the ruler to the relevant actions when creating them.

The action is an extension of org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus.  I add the action
to the Ruler popup menu. I don\'t think I have any way of changing how my
action is called.

Hi,
I am using R0.9 driver and was trying to set the font color in the Java
Editor preference.  After I changed it, the color is always black which
is the default font color.  It seems that the color setting cannot be

I assume that you talk about the breakpoints view contributed
by the ""org.eclipse.debug.ui"" plugin. The mechanisms how the vertical
ruler and the breakpoints view look up icons differ. The breakpoints
view has specific knowledge about markers representing breakpoints,
whereas the vertical ruler does not assume a specific marker type.

If you create a marker which should be rendered independently of
its state, the following is recommended: You specify a particular icon
for a particular marker type in your plugin.xml file, e.g.:
<extension point=""org.eclipse.ui.markerImageProviders"">
    <imageprovider  id=""myplugin.myMarkerProvider""
        markertype=""myplugin.mymarker""
        icon=""myiconlocation/mymarkericon.gif"">
    </imageprovider>
</extension>

Your definition is picked up by all editors relying on the provided
default implementation.

If  you create a marker that should be rendered depending on
its state, you have to provide an Annotation which masters the
required rendering. In addition, you have to make sure that for
your marker your custom annotation is created. If you deal with
your own IAnnotationModel, it depends on your implementation
how your annotation is created and added to the  model. If you
use, e.g., the ResourceAnnotationModel, you can create a subclass
of MarkerAnnotation, say MyMarkerAnnotation, and subclass
ResourceAnnotationModel overriding createMarkerAnnotation(IMarker)
to return MyMarkerAnnotation. Thus, when building an editor, you have
to configure it with document providers which return your custom
ResourceAnnotationModel. As example look at JDT. They provide their
own JavaMarkerAnnotation, annotation model, etc.
We are looking into simplifying this for the future.

to the following:

public void putString(String key, String value) {
	if(value==null) return;
	String m,n;
	m = value;
	element.setAttribute(key, value);
	n = element.getAttribute(key);
	boolean x = m.equals(n);
}

I tested this by writing a few lines of code including tabs and newlines in the 
display view and shutting down Eclipse. Since DisplayView#saveState(IMemento) 
calls XMLMemento#putString(String, String) without first modifying the value 
String (other than trmming leading and trailing whitespace), putString takes as 
input the original contents of the view, including the tabs and newlines 
(except leading and trailing tabs and newlines).

It turns out that the String fed to setAttribute and the String retrieved from 
getAttribute are equal (x is always true). All of the tabs and newline 
characters which are present in the input String are retrieved, so the xerces 
plug-in is not eliminating tab or newline characters."

For a simple test, hack the workbench save state code to add an attribute to an 
element which has tabs and newlines. In the restore state method, read this 
attribute and notice the tabs and newlines are gone now."

API released to stream:

Added to IMemento in package org.eclipse.ui:
public String getTextData()
public void putTextData(String data)

These methods are used to store Text (also known as Character Data) to an 
IMemento. Unlike the getString/putString methods of IMemento, these methods 
cause white space to be persisted.

Each IMemento is allowed only one Text node. When putTextData(String data) is 
called, data replaces the previous value of the Text node of the IMemento. For 
example, if the following code was executed, then getTextData would 
return ""World"" afterwards.

IMemento memento = new IMemento();
memento.putTextData(""Hello"");
memento.putTextData(""World"");

To use these methods, call putTextData(String value) and getTextData() where 
you would previously call putString(String key, String value) and getString
(String key).

Example

	Shell shell = new Shell ();
	shell.setLayout(new GridLayout());

	Table table = new Table(shell, SWT.NONE);
	table.setWidths(new int[] {140, 140});
	table.setLinesVisible(true);
	GridData gridData = new GridData();
	gridData.heightHint = 200;

	shell.open ();
	
	Display display = shell.getDisplay ();
	while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {
		if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();
	}

What is happening is as follows:
1) Table always has the style bits SWT.H_SCROLL  and SWT.V_SCROLL set whether you set them or not:

	Table::void createWidget (Composite parent) {
		/*
		* Feature in Windows.  It is not possible to create
		* a table that does not have scroll bars.  Therefore,
		* no matter what style bits are specified, set the
		* H_SCROLL and V_SCROLL bits so that the SWT style
		* will match the widget that Windows creates.
		*/
		style |= SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL;
		...
	}

2) In computeSize (which is called by GridLayout), Table always
calculates the space needed for the scroll bars regardless of
whether they are to be displayed or not:

	Table::public Point computeSize (int wHint, int hHint, boolean changed) {
		...
		if ((style & SWT.V_SCROLL) != 0) {
			width += OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CXVSCROLL);
		}
		if (((style & SWT.H_SCROLL) != 0) && (hHint != SWT.DEFAULT)) {
			height += OS.GetSystemMetrics (OS.SM_CYHSCROLL);
		}
		...
	}

I commented out the lines in computeSize that were adding the
width of the scrollbar to the total width and I did not see the extra space.

Both Tree and TreeItem act as containers of TreeItems; however, Trees are not 
themselves
TreeItems and cannot be treated as such.  A Java interface can be used to 
capture the
common tree item container API (getItemCount and getItem), and also makes for a
convenient place to put protocol for creating tree items and adding them to 
their container.
Both Tree and TreeItem can implement this interface.

public interface ITreeItemContainer {
	public TreeItem createTreeItemChild(int style);
	public TreeItem createTreeItemChild(int style, int position);
	public int getItemCount ();
	public TreeItem [] getItems ();
}

This allows TreeExample.expandTree to take a ITreeItemContainer as a parameter.
Clients that need to discriminate between Trees and TreeItems must use 
instanceof; 
e.g., see getPath.


I think this nicely fixes problem #1, and leads to a simpler API for the client 
that is no
more difficult to implement that the previous API.

I'll start on #2 once you've agreed that my solution to #1 is a good use of a 
Java interface

Having spent a fair amount of time inside the guts of the workbench, I can say, like many others before me, and probably even like some people from IBM say among themselves, that there is a fair bit of redundant code in the way toolbars/items/contributions are handled. At this point, the mix of FINAL declarations (SWT), use of package visible methods (SWT), checking of what can be derived and from where (SWT), and use of class names rather than generic interface (WORKBENCH) make it a crazy endeavor to try to retrofit new types of menu controls (or in my case, make it possible to switch transparently between types of widget to implement menus) inside the workbench. 

Aside from the number of generations of design inside the workbench code (I am referring to the ""this is part of a work in progress""), the root cause of the problem is a general absence of evolvability in the design of the core widget set:  I am referring to absence of common abstractions for certain shared behaviors described in this post and others, or the difficulties to extend what is already there.

Without taking away from the achievement that SWT was when it came out almost 10 years ago, and has managed to remain, I think it is healthy to allow criticism of one's work, especially when one makes the choice to make said work public.

Certainly you are in trouble here.  For example, switching in your own menu bar and remaining native just isn't happening on platforms such as Windows and the Mac.  In the case of Windows, the menu bar is hard wired into the window trim.  On the Mac, the menu bar is at the top of the display.

I would really have to be a complete idiot to not have understood that after several years of continuous use of SWT...  the fact that I added support for mac sheets to a number of dialogs and created the option to transfered the perspective switcher to a native mac toolbar controlled by a custom presentation could be mistaken for cues that I might have actually understood that and a couple of other simple facts about SWT.

On my off-work time, I am trying to build a portable Cairo backed GC implementation for all the platforms supported by Cairo. I built the basic capabilities showing that it works [tested on win and macos].  Not wanting to have to convince you that it might be beneficial, I took the route of building a EGC (extended GC) which of course bumped into the fact that GC is final (and so is Device). these and other symptoms are the reasons that make me, and it seems other people (as witnessed by some of the other posts in these bugzilla entries), say that there are some design flaws in SWT. 

I will grant you that some of them are simply the result of an increasing level of sophistication in the usage patterns of SWT (i.e. SWT falling victim to its success), but conversely, you would have to grant me (and many others) that others are the result of some avoidable (or correctable over time) design shortcomings. 

Here is one more specific case, this one falling into the category of un-anticipated direction [YES, I realize that this is not where you will want this comment entered]: at the moment, Cairo.java contains some platform and non-platform specific code. Considering that one of the core principles of SWT seem to keep the two separate, it would not have been a far fetched idea to create a CairoPlatform (or whatever you want to call it) class that would contain only the OS specific code (surface + font). So I say it is unfortunate that the Cairo support was not directly designed that way (a shared Cairo.java + a specific CairoPlatform.java).

No big deal... [I did that so that I would be able to access the font and surface apis on each of the native platforms].  But when you start down that path, you realize how much each implementation of SWT looks very different from the others, even when there are some serious real commonalities, or even when it would make sense from a strict design/elegance point of view to structure them more similarly. Now, this comment is about the insides of SWT, but it is equally applicable to the outside (the public API) that lacks some levels of common abstraction where it might have made sense from a OO point of view to have them (this bugzilla entry is certainly not the only one point at this design deficiency).

"
4394,snorthov@ca.ibm.com,2008-06-18T23:06:44Z,15,0,"First off, yes there are design flaws in SWT!

The class GC was not intended to be subclassed.  It was not written such that a person could subclass it, reimplement certain methods and get something useful.  Furthermore, it's implementation is platform specific and as such, could fall victim to the dynamic version of the fragile superclass problem.  Instances of GC are created automatically within the toolkit, for example during paint events.  For subclassing to be supported, hooks would be needed to support an alternate GC implementation. But more to the point, it is written to be as fast as possible and not intended to be pluggable.  The idea here was to avoid all possible extra overhead and complexity in design.  Since GC is not intended to be pluggable, then pluggability was not coded into the implementation.  Should this situation change, then refactoring the code will be necessary.

The class Device is not final.  It is subclassed by Printer from outside of the graphics package.  The implementation however, is very platform specific.  The idea here is to allow printing to be removed from SWT by deleting the printing package.

I do agree that the implementation of SWT could be restructured.  In the beginning, there was an effort to avoid layers such as implemenation peers for performance reasons.  Restructuring and retesting everything at this point would be a big effort, something that might make sense for e4."

trust me, it is not difficult to infer some of the rules that went into the design from the package structure. some of these idea even show their age... for example who would today choose to design a graphic API using ints for the coordinate system (yet there was a time when I used to live by Michael Abrash's DDJ column on hand optimized assembly language integer arithmetic libraries)

hence my comment about ""un-anticipated direction"" which meant ""I know that you guys did not forsee, much less want to encourage derivation of the GC type"".  However, my comment related to design was about the fact that despite some remarkable levels of similarities between them all the GC seem to follow there own local implementation rules. 

the problem I see is that in the name of making things simple, you have also closed the door to some things that people could do on their own to bring some simple improvements to SWT. Forget weak super class and hooks, and all these grand ideas...  I couldn't do something as simple as add Porter Duff alpha compositing without compiling my own version of SWT (I added ""GC.setComposite(...)"" )

4394,viliam@mailbox.sk,2008-06-19T12:06:47Z,17,0,"We need common interfaces for another simple thing: We develop a framework that generates UIs and has a control factory to create controls. Control factory can generate either, say, Label or CLabel, Combo or CCombo or even custom implementation etc. Common interfaces would make such thing lot easier: look at the code of org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ComboViewer: it's source would be one half shorter with ICombo, and even able to use other Combo-like implementations.

I workaround it by defining my own interfaces and subclassing like this:

[code]
public interface IButton extends IControl {
	public void setText(String text);
	public String getText();
	public void setImage(Image image);
	public void addSelectionListener (SelectionListener listener);
	//.... other button-like methods
}

public class StandardButton extends Button implements IButton {
	public StandardButton(Composite parent, int style) {
		super(parent, style);
	}
	protected void checkSubclass() {
	}
	// no other code
}
[/code]

It works for me except for CCombo (see bug 235968) and Table/TreeItems of virtual tables (i.e. not created by me).

These, and other signs, are what make me think that ""evolvability"" did not rank very high in the list of design goals for SWT. to me, these issues create the impression that SWT was more meant as an embedded GUI API, or as a fixed simple public API, than as a evolvable foundation layer (the scope of this comment is very specific and is not a general judgement of other aspects of SWT).

This is where I (I can't imagine being the only one) see an inconsistency between your design decisions and the reality of the SWT code: I can appreciate that you have decided (prerogative of the chief designer) that ""it is limited to a widget per widget scope"".  Fine, then by all means, make it so... consistently.  And as the chief implementor, ensure that your design rules are followed by you and others, and that each widget uses its very own local implementation.  But that is not how the code is written, and in many cases the default widget set is re-using the base implementation.  So there is the idea that it is ""per widget"", the reality that most of them actually share it, and the limitation that it is not really ALL the widgets, because anything created by third parties in a different package name than ""org.eclipse.swt"" would not be able to access it.  Someone smarter than me said that ""principles are the things we hang on to when it is hard to do it"".

I chose this example because it was almost trivial, and therefore suited to convey an idea.  But there are many more like that one, some of them not so ridiculous, like for the instance the problem referenced by this bugzilla entry.  Starting to understand why I wonder if SWT is in a sense more extensible by accident than by design? 

the point I have been trying to make in multiple instances, and which has more often than not been swiftly brushed away (or discarded in favor or pointing out some menial details in the posts), is that SWT is full of these inconsistencies, or sometimes unfinished ideas (the latter is more true of the platform code than of SWT).  And what I have noticed while reading hundreds of past bug entries is that there is a pattern of not revisiting these annoyances/inconsistencies between successive versions.  Thinking about the 100s of millions of dollars resting on this technology, I simply question wether it is fitting the current level of responsibility resting on SWT and the eclipse core.  Frankly, I am rather scared to see the core team everyone gun-hoe about a JavaScript version of SWT when so many serious entries, like this one, have been pending a real resolution for years (this is another good one: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=235968).

"
4394,ljpm27@gmail.com,2008-06-21T03:28:05Z,21,0,"And just to clarify, I say ""have been pending a real resolution for years"", because some of these problems (like this one in particular) have had some rippling effect inside the rest of the Workbench code or the code developed outside.

Here is another example of the lack of evolvability of SWT (I say this one due to inconsistency):  the ""display"" field is to the ""Widget"" hierarchy what the ""device"" field is to the ""Resource"" hierarchy.  Then why the difference in their treatment:  the Widget constructor takes care of setting ""display"", while there is no way to set ""device"" from a custom build Resource"" (Widget constructor is public while Resource constructor is package only).

Now, I know that if there is an answer at all, it will be closer to ""but why do you mess with your own Resource type. there is really no scenario at all where you would need to"", than to a ""hmmm... interesting.. let me see if there might be a case for that, it could simply be that we overlooked it""...  but the optimistic in me keeps seeking the ""Open"" part of ""Open Source"" in places where it does not seem to have been implemented yet.

	SWT 0.39:
	While trying to ""beautify"" VAME for Motif I've got the impression that the Motif implementation

	""Coordination"" means: It should be possible to compose larger controls from single controls without

	so that things line up nicely, double borders are avoided etc. and this all without too many tweaks in client code.

	A classical example is how to align a label and a button so that the text baselines
	line up independent of the size of both controls and the fonts used.

	SWT 0.43 Patch 0.002

	After running the following code I would expect the tree to have no selection.

		Shell shell= new Shell();
		shell.setSize(500, 500);
		
		// create Tree with 3 items
		Tree tree= new Tree(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.MULTI);
		tree.setBounds(10, 10, 200, 200);
		TreeItem root= new TreeItem(tree, SWT.NONE);
		root.setText(""root"");
		TreeItem ti= new TreeItem(root, SWT.NONE);
		ti.setText(""item1"");
		ti= new TreeItem(root, SWT.NONE);
		ti.setText(""item2"");
		ti= new TreeItem(root, SWT.NONE);
		ti.setText(""item3"");
		
		// remember last item and select it
		TreeItem remembered= ti;
		tree.setSelection(new TreeItem[] { remembered } );
		
		// deselect all
		tree.deselectAll();	// nothing should be selected in tree
		
		// replace the last item with a new one
		ti= new TreeItem(root, SWT.NONE);
		ti.setText(""new"");
		remembered.dispose();	// comment out and it works

		// ERROR: item ""new"" is selected

		shell.open();
		
		Display display= shell.getDisplay();

		while (!shell.isDisposed())
			if (!display.readAndDispatch())
				display.sleep();

SN (5/24/00 10:34:42 AM)
	Thanks.  I stepped through the code and changed it slightly so that the tree
	would be visible.  It appears that Tree.deselectAll () is working fine but that
	deleting the focus item (whether selected or not) causes another another
	node to become the focus item and get selected.

	How important is this problem?  I have verifed that you are getting a selection
	callback when the new item is selected.

AW (25.05.00 14:28:10)
	We have a workaround that tries to avoid the sequence of deselectAll and dispose calls.
	It seems to work for now.

SN (5/25/00 9:47:40 AM)
	Thanks.  The real problem is that the Windows tree really hates to have nothing
	selected.  For example, if you set focus to a tree that has nothing selected, Windows
	will select an item.  There are other cases.

	What I'm getting at is that despite how bogus this is, it may be a case of platform
	behavior that we have to live with.

	When the tree widget is loosing focus the selection disappears. This is 
a serious problem when building 
    VAJ like browsers. The selection in the tree widget shows you the path 
where you came from. Without the
	selection in the tree you loose this context. Is this a native 
limitation?

    It is also inconsistent with other widgets, List preserves the selection 
when it looses focus. 

NOTES:

	SN (4/21/99 10:33:13 AM)
		We don't see this behavior here.  There are bits that I set 
that are supposed to
		draw the selection when it loses focus (it draws ""gray"" instead 
of ""blue"") but apps
		like the Explorer don't set these bits.

		I tried NT and Windows 98.  If you are running Windows 95 with 
no service packs
		the bits are not honoured and the selection will always 
disappear.  At any rate, it
		should only be a visual thing.  If you query the tree when it 
doesn't have focus, it
		should still claim that the item is selected.

		You need to be running the Common Controls DLL Version 4.71 (or 
greater) or all
		sorts of things won't work.  To get this DLL, download the 
lastest IE.  IE replaces
		all sorts of system DLL's when it installs.


EG (23.04.99 13:48:13)
	checked the DLL version it is 4.72.3609.2200

KH (4/23/99 11:54:58 AM)
	I tried your example and because you have set the background color to 
grey you are not seeing
	the ""disabled"" selection in the tree. For now you should change the 
background color to any other
	color. 

	Changing this PR to be a DCR for us to investigate the possibility of 
controlling the tree's disabled
	color. 

SN (4/29/99 12:38:09 PM)
	There is no Windows API to do this.  Moving to fixed.

GDA (4/30/99 10:09:56 AM)
	To confirm, you are claiming
		1)	There is no way to set the selection color
		2) There is no way to set the disable selection color (other 
than a choice of show nothing (useless), show gray)
		3) There is no way to tell it to leave the selection showing 
even when the widget loses focus

	Note: From ui perspective having the selection go away (as opposed to 
the gray it mode) is very bad.
		Even the graying is misleading because it implies the object 
selection is not active when in fact
		it actually is.


SN (4/30/99 4:14:59 PM)
	1) and 2) are correct.  3) is wrong.  It should read:

For example,
1) Add a field:
	boolean openCalled = false;

2) Check and set the flag after the checkWidget() in the open() method:
	if (openCalled) {
		reopen ();
		return;
	}
	openCalled = true;


3) ... where ""reopen()"" simply does the following (all API calls):
void reopen () {
	if (isDisposed ()) return;
	if (!getVisible ()) setVisible (true);
	if (getMinimized ()) setMinimized (false);
	bringToTop ();  // or moveAbove (null);
	setActive ();
	setFocus ();

It's kind of ""brute force"" but the advantages are:
- no subtle cases
- no event loops on X
- it's already implemented, and it works <g>

	Why do I have to invert the colors in order to get the expected result?
	Why do I have to use white in the transparent areas? In Images I have to use black!

	In addition the black parts of the cursor are xor-ed with the background.
	Builtin cursors don't have this behavior!

	AWT inside SWT and SWT inside AWT work on Windows under the JDK.

	AWT inside SWT works on photon.  The other direction has not yet
	been tested.

	There is a problem on the Motif platform:

	When trying to create an MEmbeddedFrame from an SWT Handle, I get the 
following error.
	The error goes away when we use statically linked X libraries.

		We need to reach some kind of closure on the Swing interop
		story. I would like to see this working on all platforms, 
including the
		light widget focus issue.

	JB (28/08/2001 12:16:11 PM)
		On Win32, AWT/Swing interop has been substantially improved but 
requires
			fixes to the Activate mechanism that are only present 
in the 1.0NL code
			stream.
		On Motif we are encountering difficulties with the JDK's 
libawt.so library
			as it is statically linkd to Xm.  The only workable 
solution is to obtain a new
			libawt.so that is dynamically linked to libXm (tried a 
number of variations on
			SWT's linking but it always fails while initializing Xm 
in SWT).
			Noted that AWT is quite happy with XInitThreads().
		On Photon with the our AWT implementation on J9, 
java.awt.Toolkit
			contains a disabled getDefaultToolkit2() method that 
would permit
			interop.  There is apparently no way to access this 
short of changing

Ultimately yes, but there's no reason waiting for Sun. There are plenty of
people who would be happy to install the IBM Linux JRE, if they could get Swing
support in SWT, including me. This is outside the scope of pure Java anyway and
doesn't break anything in Java, so I can't image anybody being tied up by Sun
_not_ to do it. I guess we now also want the similar change for OSX (or is it
already dynamically linked there?).

Please let me know when a test version of the IBM JRE with dynamically linked
AWT is available, I'd like to test EmbeddedSwing on it before such a new JRE is
released. (EmbeddedSwing being my fully working replacement for the experimental
SWT_AWT). We know of course that once this is solved, full Java2D is available
in SWT programs.

BTW, I can confirm that this statically linked AWT is exactly what is stopping
EmbeddedSwing on Linux SWT."

JM (12/07/99 10:41:04)- The method is speced as returning the first selected

	The method is actually speced as returning the index of
	a selected item that contains the focus rectangle 
	or the index of the first selected item is return.

	On Windows the first item gets the focus rectangle,
	on AIX the last item gets the focus rectangle so the
	behaviour of getSelectionIndex() is correct.  I'll check
	with steve to see if we want to rationalize the behaviour
	of the focus rectangle between the two platforms.  The following
	code displays the list so we can see the focus rectangle.

	Shell s = new Shell();

	Please always submit test code.

JH (12/22/99 1:46:08 PM)
	Here's a test case - sorry if it's a little long. I have two classes: TreeGpfTest and TreeNode. 
	TreeGpfTest is mostly scavenged from the SWT examples so it should look somewhat
	familiar. Running TreeGpfTest will bring up a window with a tree and a button at the
	bottom. Clicking the button will attempt to ensure that a tree path is expanded and then 
	set the selection to the last item in the path. If the tree path isn't already expanded, then 
	this should cause the GPF. That is, if you bring up the window and hit the button then you'll
	get the GPF.

	The code actually GPFs in Tree.setSelection() but changing the code in TreeGpfTest.getTestItem() to
	look like:
	
				if (!testItem.getExpanded()) {				
					if (testItem.getItems().length == 1 && testItem.getItems()[0].getText().equals(falseNodeText)) {
						// dispose of dummy items
						TreeItem [] dummyNodes = testItem.getItems ();
						for (int n = 0; n < dummyNodes.length; n++) dummyNodes[n].dispose ();
						expandTree (lastItem);
					} else {
						testItem.setExpanded(true);
					}			
				}

	instead of:

			if (!testItem.getExpanded()) {
				expandTree(testItem);
			}			

	will prevent the GPF.

SN (12/23/99 12:11:53 PM)
	Does not GP in VA/Java but throws a null pointer exception.

SN (12/23/99 1:03:42 PM)
	Ok, I know what's happening but I don't understand the failure mode.
	The example code is selecting a node that's not visible.  This causes
	the tree to expand to show the node.  The application's expand callbacks
	delete the children and this deletes the node that the application is trying
	to select.  I don't understand the GP or null pointer exception yet.

SN (1/4/00 5:28:00 PM)
	I hacked a quick fix that avoided the null pointer exception and
	this GP'd after sending the expand callbacks in TVM_SELECTITEM.

	It looks like deleting the item that is about to be selected inside
	of an expand callback (that is sent because the tree must expand
	to show the item about to be selected) causes Windows it GP
	when it finally get's around to selecting the item.

	I have no idea how to work around this.

4434,christophe.cornu+eclipse@gmail.com,2003-03-07T16:14:35Z,4,0,"I believe bug 33834 could be a variant of this test case.
We are testing a workaround for this bug 4434 (and we are trying to understand 
the scope under which this problem occurs). This should also provide a fix for bug 
33834.

With a recent version of SWT (>= Eclipse 2.1 RC1), the test case in this PR causes 
the following events.
- within the expand callback, a tree item is disposed
- SWT removes the tree item from the tree table. 
- TVM_DELETEITEM is called to destroy the OS tree item.
The problem is that, for some reason, this TVM_DELETEITEM causes a 
TVN_ITEMEXPANDING resulting in another SWT.Expand event. At this stage,
the OS considers the tree item to still be there (TVM_GETITEM etc return it), but it 
has already been removed from the SWT tree table.
- this causes TreeItem.getItems() to possibly return an array with a null item, 
causing the NPE. (remember: we are all here still before returning from the call to
TVM_DELETEITEM).

One workaround is to detect that case by checking for a null item in 
Tree.wmNotify.TVN_ITEMEXPANDING and in TreeItem.getItems

The only possibility would be to add an ""adjustLast"" or ""stretch"" flag that 
would stretch the last item in the row to take up the space left over.  This 
would cause the inner RowLayout to be resized to be too small when it wraps in 
the shell and then it would also wrap.  It would also cause the buttons and

	If the programmer defines a layout incorrectly, a corresponding exception should

	An option would be to ignore the offending widget and not lay it out at all. That

	One way to reduce the number of adapter classes for typed listeners is to
	bring down the number of methods in the corresponding listener interface to one.
	(In this case you don't need default implementations for the methods you are not interested in,
	so you don't need an adapter).

	Folding listener methods into one especially makes sense if the typical  handler code is similar.
	On the other hand a field has to be added to the typed event to distinguish the different cases.
	
	I've looked through the listeners and found the following interfaces where the above applies IMHO: 
		FocusListener:	focusGained/focusLost
		KeyListener: keyPressed/keyReleased
		MenuListener: menuHidden/menuShown 
		SelectionListener: widgetDoubleSelected/widgetSelected
		TreeListener: treeCollapsed/treeExpanded

	By doing this it would be possible to eliminate 5 of 8 adapters.

	JFace legacy provides a CellContainer that is used heavily in existing

    the migration to JFace2000. We have tried to implement CellContainer on top of GridLayout, but
    the models are too different and we had to give up. The major difference is that
    in CellContainer (which is based on GridBagLayout) you can position a widget
    directly by giving coordinates e.g. 3, 4 and you don't have to worry about empty cells.
    Emulating this with the GridLayout would require to insert dummy filler widgets into

KH (8/12/99 9:21:14 AM)

ColumnTypes and TypeEditors have nothing to do with widgets. Am I missing 
something? But what 
is the difference between pressing a checkbox that happens to be in a table and 
pressing a checkbox 
anywhere else in the UI? As far as the widget is concerned an event is fired in 
both cases.

I want to be clear about this. I acknowledge that VA2000 will have a 
requirement for property editors and 
this will have to support editing values in tables that are not strings. I 
envision having to support at 
least: buttons (of several flavors - push, check etc) , combo boxes etc.  
VA/Java uses this. It may be possible to implement table editing using real 
native widgets and make them appear 
to be children of the table widget but I strongly suspect that we will not be 
able to do this. You have seen 
some of the problems already with the size of the combobox. There are internal 
technical reasons why 
using native widgets causes problems as well. But you and other SWT users 
should not have to care 
about how it is implemented. The support you can expect from SWT is the ability 
to insert and remove 
widget like things in table items and receive callbacks when the user interacts 
with them. Erich and I have 
talked about this and we both agree that the enabling work to put ""widgets"" 
into the table, handle resize 
events, scrolling etc properly belongs in SWT. High level support to validate 
input, map between types 
and editors belongs in the viewers. (Erich if I have misrepresented you then

The embedded profiler has a situation where program control of item positioning 
in a tree widget is needed (similar to setTopIndex() for List).

After looking a bit at the code and at the Win Common Controls spec, I have
discovered the following:  It looks like the setSelection() method in Tree sends 
the TVM_SELECTITEM message with the TVGN_CARET flag to set the 
selection in the tree.  According to the spec a flag of
TVGN_FIRSTVISIBLE  is also allowed, which attempts to position the tree
so that the given item is the first one visible.  Surfacing this feature via an
API on Tree would allow the profiler to set the item position.  This information
was found at

	If I disable a Button which shows a 89a gif with transparency I get a 
grey rectangle.
	It seems that the transparency mask is not used when generating the 
greyed out image.

NOTES:

JM (8/17/99 12:20:36 PM) - This is probably because we actually set a bitmap, 
not an icon, into
	the button, so the OS doesn't know about the transparency. 

JM (08/18/99 11:51:03) - Is it possible that jface should be using icons (.ICO 
files) instead
	of GIFs? They work on both windows and unix and solve these types of 
problems.

KH (8/18/99 11:46:58 AM)

	You are correct, the mask is not used when the OS generates the greyed 
out image. 
In order to ensure that transparent images are rendered as fast as possible we 
rely on the fact 
that the background color of the widget is static and make you set the 
background color of the image
to match the widget's background color.This enables us to ignore transparency 
in the OS because 
you have taken care of setting the color for us.  On platforms like Motif, the 
widgets do not support 
transparency at all.

AW (06.09.99 10:05:10)
	So what does this mean for me? Should I use .ICO files?

JM (9/7/99 4:33:52 PM) -
	1) Where can I get the exact gif you are having a problem with?
	2) Are you setting the background color of the button at all?
	3) Please verify this is a Button you're talking about (not a tool item 
or something).
	4) Are you using the image.setBackground(button.getBackground()) call?
	I tried the following using the oti.gif (distributed with VA/Java), and 
everything looked good:

		Shell s = new Shell();
		s.open();
		Image i = new Image(s.getDisplay(), ""C:\\graphics\\oti.gif"");
		Button b = new Button(s, SWT.PUSH);
		b.setBounds(10, 10, 50, 50);
		i.setBackground(b.getBackground());
		b.setImage(i);
		b.setEnabled(false);

JM (9/8/99 9:13:13 AM) - This is an NT-specific feature. ToolBars are okay, 
buttons are not.
	As a temporary workaround, you can do the following, ONLY if you're 
running NT.
	When you set the button's state to disabled, also set the background 
color of the image
	to white. This is not necessary under '95, and will make the button 
look incorrect under
	unix.
		Image i = new Image(...);
		Button b = new Button(...);
		i.setBackground(b.getBackground());
		b.setImage(i);
		...
		Color white = new Color(255,255,255);
		b.setEnabled(false);
		i.setBackground(white);
		...
		b.setEnabled(true);
		i.setBackground(b.getBackground());

JM (09/15/99 13:17:54) - The fix is in Button. If we are running NT and the 
image has
	transparency, Button will make a copy of it and whack the color table 
so that
	the transparent color is white. The original image will be restored 
when the
	button is re-enabled. Note that this will ONLY help us preserve the 
proper shape
	of the image in the button; the contents of the image will still look 
bad for
	any color other than white, which essentially means you'll still have a 
grey
	blob, but it'll have shape.


JM (9/16/99 10:32:43 AM) - 

Here's where we were when weleft today:
1. Fix the transparency in Button so that if the user puts a transparent GIF
into a disabled button, at least the shape will be right.
2. Tell the user if they really care about what happens when the button
is disabled (on NT only), store a second bitmap as monochrome and
setImage() the button when you disable it.

After talking with SWT, we have an alternative story. The whole
Image.setBackground() story has problem from the start; consider
the case where widget colors change, for example - to get it right we'd have to 
hook callbacks and notify the user, etc etc etc.
As well, we are making the user (and ourselves) work too hard, since
none of the native controls on any platform support such a thing. So the 
proposal
is as follows:
1. Claim absolutely no support for transparent GIFs in any widget.
2. Still support loading GIFs, and do the right thing when drawing them in a GC.
3. If set into a widget, a GIF would simply be treated like any other bitmap, 
and
the transparency information would be ignored.
4. If the user desires to have transparent images in a widget, then they will
use Icons (either by loading from ICO or doing some magic to convert - loading
from an ICO seems more reasonable). Native windows controls supports this
format for transparency.

The benefits of this approach:
1. Changing the system colors would work; the transparency would be
maintained, and we wouldn't have to fart about telling the user to change 
colors.
2. Simplification of API. (setBackground is kind of weird)
3. We wouldn't be confusing to the user as to the capabilities of the platform
4. We wouldn't have to do all kinds of extra work to disable the image etc. 
etc.,
it would just happen.

The disadvantages of this approach:
1. Users would have to convert their GIFs to ICOs.
2. Since Motif doesn't support transparency at all, we still haven't completely
solved the motif story, but we have simplified it since they wouldn't have to
mess with setBackground() stuff.

Comments?


KH (9/16/99 10:32:49 AM) - 
We are already claiming no support in the widgets for transparent GIFs. 
This is exactly the reason why they have to set the background color. 
If we tell them to use icons instead we are setting ourselves up for a trap
 when we run into platforms that only support fixed size icons.

Drawing transparent gifs correctly in the GC is already supported. This 
support can not be removed. The problem is with the widgets and 
deciding how best to support this. Here are the constraints as I see them:

	1) We must enable users to set arbitrary sized transparent images into 
widgets in a portable way.

	2) Drawing must be fast. Any preprocessing has to happen when the image 
is set into the widget.
	    Not when the control is being displayed. (ie. No owner draw crap to 
support transparency)

	3) When the widget is disabled we have to do something reasonable. 
Either we take care of this
	internally or we tell the user what they have to do before calling 
setEnabled(false). As long as
	widgets never get disabled for free. (ie. It is always the user who 
calls setEnabled()) then this is
	OK.

	4) I would prefer not to have widgets have to manage copies of these 
resources. Code like this
	is difficult to maintain

JM (9/16/99 10:33:05 AM) - 
Discussion about this PR has opened a other issues regarding transparent GIFs 
and
how to handle them. The primary problem is that transparent GIFs are NOT 
supported
by any platform (in terms of putting them in widgets), so we have to do some 
magic,
such as setBackground().  The problem with this approach is that it is not 
perfect. 
For starters, it exposed the bug you found (which can be worked around). But 
more
importantly, the fact that transparent GIFs in widgets are not supported shows 
through 
in the
case where, for example, you change your system colors. In this case, the area 
around
the image will remain the old color, and the rest of the button will change. SN 
believes that it is important for an app that claims to be 
native to
behave natively; getting the system colors wrong sounds more like something a 
Swing
app would do. Note that this discussion applies not only to Buttons but also to 
ToolBars,
Labels, and other controls that support images.

Don't run out and change all your
graphics to ICO files... we just wanted you to know the state of our 
discussions.

As the three of us have discussed, the use of real icons (ICO files) would 
alleviate this
problem; icons are supported natively by widgets and it is, in fact, the only 
way that they
will support transparency short of a complicated owner-draw story. However, ICO 
files
have certain platform-dependent limitations, such as icon size and color depth, 
that
may limit their use.

In the short term, I have some code for you to try. If this fixes the problem 
and looks
satisfactory, we have a version of this code we can put in Button to do this 
automatically.
It doesn't fix the more fundamental problems above, but it does work around a 
curious
behaviour in NT.

		String filename = """"; // put transparent gif name here
		Shell s = new Shell();
		s.open();
		Image i = new Image(s.getDisplay(), filename);
		Button b = new Button(s, SWT.PUSH);
		b.setBounds(0, 0, 100, 100);
		i.setBackground(b.getBackground());
		b.setImage(i);
		// When you set the button disabled, change the background
		// color of the image to white.
		Color white = new Color(255,255,255);
		b.setEnabled(false);
		i.setBackground(white);

Where in the vame ide do you have transparent images in buttons
that you disable? In about how many places does this occur?

AW (22.09.99 21:08:04)
	The code from above fixes the problem for me.

	There is a single place in LeapFrog where we have a button with a 
transparent image which is sometimes disabled:
		its the merge direction button in the MergeViewer (located in 
the viewer's  header between the two text panes).

JM (9/24/99 9:54:04 AM) - We will put the fix in Button to fix this PR, and 
leave the other limitations for now.

JM (10/25/99 12:45:59 PM) - Did some research on icons.
	On a 256-color display, you get ONLY the colors in the default palette 
(16)
	On a high-color display, you only get the colors in the default palette 
UNLESS you select
	""Use all available colors for icons"" in windows settings, in which case 
you can have them all.
	Putting the icon in an imagelist doesn't help.

JM (04/27/00 14:19:23)- I believe we have dealt with this problem:
	1. User can explicitly create an Icon using new Image(Display, 
ImageData, ImageData)
	2. User can also query the icon color depth of the display using 
Display.getIconDepth()

	McQ (10/10/2000 3:47:18 PM) -
		SQ and CM to investigate the status of this and come talk to me.

CM (10/10/00 4:08:36 PM)
	Display.getIconDepth() exists and seems to work fine (returns 4 on my 
NT machine).
	So if the user wants to go that route (change to icon on the fly) they 
can. They may
	lose color depth, though - they can decide.

	Tried JM's code (change background to white on disable, back to shell 
background on enable)
	using the little example class below. I left the program running while 
changing the system's colors
	and it works fine. I ONLY tried this on NT - would appreciate it if 
someone else tried it elsewhere too.
	If you comment out the image.setBackground hack, it does not work (i.e. 
the disabled button is just a
	grey blob, as described by AW at the beginning of this PR). So the hack 
code was NOT put into Button
	to do this automatically. If we put it in, we probably have to be 
careful to check that the user has not
	already set the background color of the image. If he has, we don't do 
this.

	once on the start of the resize event, and then again in my hook. This 
happens because layout happens first on a
	resize instead of last, so any hint changes during the resize 
processing aren't seen.

	I've included a sample class to show the problem. Clicking the check 
box on and off will show the change.

	Thanks.

4460,James_Moody@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T18:17:09Z,0,0,"There are many cases in our API where we incorrectly use the Point
class simply because it encapsulates two integers. In many of these
situations, we really want an Interval class (with fields start and end),
or a Dimension class (with fields width and height).

As examples:
Image.getBounds() should return a Dimension instead of a Rectangle, since
 an Image has no x or y value, just width and height.
Text.getSelection() should return an Interval instead of a Point, since the
 selection has no x or y values, just start and end.

There are many other cases where this incorrect mapping occurs, and it
can cause confusion over the actual semantics of API. In the example above,
does getSelection() actually return me the row and column of the selected
text? I might think so, since a point has x and y values. The addition of a
couple of simple domain objects and the changing of some of our API now might
make things easier for the user later.

"
4460,dlwhiteman@us.ibm.com,2001-11-19T17:33:41Z,2,0,"Let me add my ""vote"" to James' comments.  Making an OO library usable requires 
good naming, and ""x"" and ""y"" are simply not good names for the cases that James 
outlines above.  This concern was also raised by chemi_ordax@yahoo.com on the 
eclipse.tools newsgroup."
4460,sharples@nz1.ibm.com,2002-04-16T22:21:02Z,3,0,"I agree with James and David. 

It is (IMHO) poor OO design to think about a class purely in terms of the data 
it encapsulates. Classes have both *data* and behaviour. A Point encapsulates an 
(x,y) point in coordinate space, sure; but it has the potential to do more than 
that, such as offer the ability to translate() the point to a different (x,y) 
location. If Point is also being used to represent Dimension, does it make sense 
to have a Dimension.translate()? Or a Point.grow()? No, of course not.

The current API may be minimalist, but to be minimalist to the point of 
excluding functionality seems to be shooting yourself in the foot. I've entered 
feature request #13950 as a potential solution."
4460,Mike_Wilson@ca.ibm.com,2002-04-17T13:28:47Z,4,0,"This entire discussion presupposes that an SWT Point is somehow related to the 
more mathematically oriented ""Point"" you find in AWT and elsewhere. You need 
to understand that this is *not* such a beast. 

In SWT a Point is simply a data structure with two slots, used to pass values 
to OS routines which require that shape. It does not have interesting API, 
since the operating systems SWT is built also do not.

Just so you know, the ""poor OO design"" Colin is talking about is actually >15 
years (separately, by multiple people) of serious, practical experience 
dealing with the problems of directly interfacing OO languages with non-OO 
windowing systems. If his experience with this problem is comparable, he 
should apply to work for OTI.
"
4460,dlwhiteman@us.ibm.com,2002-04-17T13:42:51Z,5,0,"Perhaps it should have a different name, since the class name Point suggests 
either the mathematical Point or the AWT Point (or both).  The name certainly 
doesn't suggest a ""two slot data structure"", and also doesn't have descriptive 
names for the variables when used for things like ""height"" and ""width""."
4460,sharples@nz1.ibm.com,2002-04-17T21:48:14Z,6,0,"If Point is just a data structure of two ints, why not get rid of it altogether, 
and just use an int[2] (and int[4] instead of Rectangle)?

The thing is, to the OS (and to the SWT designer), it is just two ints. To the 
SWT *user*, though, it is a class just like any other. In my *limited* 
experience of programming GUIs in OO languages, it is extremely helpful to think 
about what you are modelling in pure OO terms, even if what's going on in the 
actual windowing system is non-OO and doesn't care about classes. An API which 
assists you in doing that is very useful.

I'm not trying to suggest that SWT as a whole is badly designed. On the 
contrary, it is extremely well-designed and implemented. I have abandoned Swing 
altogether in favour of SWT, and I'm sure many others will do likewise. However, 
there are certain aspects of the SWT API that are not very user-friendly. An 
experienced SWT user probably doesn't worry about such things, particularly if 
they're used to dealing with the nitty-gritty OS level. Learners like myself, on 
the other hand, can find it a bit frustrating.

I think that SWT could easily become part of the core Java language, as an 
alternative or complement to (not replacement for) AWT/Swing. I hope the SWT 
team don't feel they have to position SWT as a competitor to AWT."
4460,Mike_Wilson@ca.ibm.com,2002-04-18T13:57:31Z,7,0,"Actually, we could have used an array of two ints, except for one small detail 
which is internal to the implementation: when native API is called, it 
translates the representation of ""Point"" arguments between the Java memory 
layout and the OS specific layout by doing getIntField calls 
(see ""getPOINTFields"" in the file ""structs.c""). Although these could have been 
coded as array references instead, the current code matches the pattern used 
for all the other ""classes which are really structs"", which seems like a good 
idea given how important consistancy is when working at this low level.

I understand the point you are making about thinking in OO versus OS terms. 
All I can say is, our current philosophy is to, as much as possible, avoid 
adding new concepts and features which do not model directly some platform 
funtionality. Our two biggest exceptions to this rule, the typed listener 
support in org.eclipse.swt.events and the custom widgets in 
org.eclipse.swt.custom, were both done only after a great deal of discussion 
in which we finally convinced ourselves that we could not provide a first-
class toolkit without them.

Similarly, I *do* appreciate the discussion we are having here. You'll have to 
pardon the tone of my previous post. It was made while made under a great deal 
of external stress.

JM (01/24/00 15:47:12) - Font would then be the ONLY graphics object with a getDisplay(); none of the others have

DB (1/25/00 2:12:45 PM)
	I need the same functionality for Images too. Of course I can put a display and a font/image object into a
	separate object and manage this. But for me this is just a work around.

JM (1/25/00 2:29:02 PM) - Rather than have a container object for the pair, is it possible for you to just maintain
	a hash table of Graphics objects -> Display mappings? In my opinion, this type of solution would be
	much preferable than growing an extra slot and an extra method on every single graphics object that exists.
	If I grew the slot, it would exist solely for the purposes of getDisplay(), and it seems that the user code
	is a better place to remember this information.

DB (1/26/00 11:56:59 AM)
	I already have a hash table that maps a display to a font. But sometimes I only have a single font object and
	I want to deceide whether it can be used for a window or not by simply comparing the displays. In these

can not write code to respond to slider events during scrolling, nor can they do any

syncExec.

It appears that the OS creates a separate loop to read and dispatch events during scrolling and 
our (AWT) readAndDispatch loop waits, as a side effect of waiting runAsyncMessages is not called 
during this time.  We made a quick hack to post a special message to ourselves whenever a new 
syncExec runnable was added and when the windowProc saw that message it would run one async
runnable, this gave acceptable behaviour (we are not saying it is any sort of solution).

NOTES:

KR (5/8/00 5:34:14 PM)
	This feature just got me again. 
	I changed the focus out listener of Tree to force an update after the selection was 
	redrawn. 
	This is intended to fix repaint behavior that previously left the focus item blank while 
	the application did a time consuming operation in its own focus out listener.
	However, the Tree does not know that it no longer has the focus because, during the 
	repaint, getFocusControl() still returns the Tree since the focus event processing is 
	not complete at that point.
	Bottom line: This PR needs to be fixed.

SN (5/9/00 2:43:40 PM)
	This is super hard to fix without ""faking out"" the OS.  All we do is query the OS
	so as the real focus widget at that time is different on the different platforms.
	So, if we try and fake it, we open ourselves up for bizzare bugs and behavior
	because we no longer match reality.

	I understand why this is a problem for you.  Focus events are ""sent"" on all platforms.
	We cannot post them because, if we wait for the event loop, you'll get weird behavior
	For example, if you open a bunch of windows and then fall back to the event loop,
	the windows will have opened, changed focus from one to the other etc. and then you'll
	start getting the callbacks, not actually at the time that the focus was changed.

	I am open to suggestions.  On possibility is to use a slot in the event to contain
	the correct value.  BTW:  What should the value be?

KR (5/10/00 10:25:26 AM)
	getFocusControl() should return the widget that actually has focus at that time.
	If Motif sends the focus out event when the old widget still has focus (ie. AboutToLooseFocus)
	then SWT would be lying if getFocusControl() returned the new focus widget. 
	The best solution would be to do some magic so that the new widget already has focus 
	when the FocusOut event is sent.
	If you provide the focus widget in a slot (or somewhere else) it should be the new focus widget.
	In the FocusOut listener you know the widget that lost focus - in most cases it's the receiver.
	(or you can check the event.widget field). There's no other way of finding out the new focus 
	widget 	though, so that should be provided somewhere else. It would also be consistent with 
	the FocusIn event - both focus events would then provide the 	new focus widget.
	You don't necessarily have to provide the new focus widget at all. You could just doc in
	getFocusControl that the return value is platform specific if used within a focus listener.
	I could store the focus state in a field of my own to work around this.

DR (5/10/00 11:56:14 AM)
	Unfortunately there is no good way for us to fix getFocusControl().  
	The OS will simply not provide the required information.  
	We will have to comment getFocusControl() that the return value is 
	platform specific when inside a LoseFocus event.

	If you are looking for a path to consistant code between 
	the two platforms the event widget is consistant between the two platforms.  
	The widget in the LoseFocus event is the widget that is really losing focus, 
	the widget in the GainFocus event is really the widget gaining focus.

	image lists is not exposed in the SWT API. 
		
	Many times you will have a fixed set of images and you want to share them. (Think of the windows explorer, 
	there can be many items in the tabel and they share the same image) We assume that identical images can
	share the same index. If we can not assume this then we could not share any images even though they are

	Scrapbook wad works on Deans Linux, however,
	the Listener test examples do not.

JM(12/07/99 15:09:27) - Strangeness. The scrapbook wad now works on my machine.

JM (12/07/99 15:30:52) - 
	The listener tests are bogus because they don't use compute
	size, they just hardcode the button heights to 20. Because 20 is not enough
	room to display the entire label, motif doesn't display any of it.
	Solution: fix the examples to use computeSize and all will be happy.
	PR re-titled.

JM (12/07/99 15:39:41)- Bruce, the examples need to either use computeSize in the resize()
	method (which can get hairy since all the subclasses override and call super),
	or use a layout which will take care of these things automatically. I suggest a layout
	of some kind.

decoration is needed for the following cases:

1) When table column is used to display icons, it is narrow (normally about 19 
pixels to host 16 pixel icon). Consequently,
it would be more appropriate to use icon for the column header as well, since 
there is no space for text.

2) Column header that show text may need additional iconic decoration to 
indicate that the table is currently
sorted on that column, as well as the sorting order (ascending vs. descending). 
Normally, this is achieved
with an icon that is some variation of down arrow (normal sort) or up arrow 
(reverse sort). Again,
Microsoft Outlook and many other applications use this capability.

PROBLEM:
	If you create a table and have FULL_SELECTION without HIDE_SELECTION,
you get ugly blue/gray highlighting when you use tableEditors to edit cells. 
This is also
bad when the table loses focus and you try to maintain a selection in the Table.
The selection goes grey. 

Ideally, we would like to have the entire selection stay blue when a cell is 
being 
edited.
Here is the example:
Modify the main() method in com.ibm.jface.examples.table.TableExample to not
include HIDE_SELECTION in the style bits of the Table.
Run the example.
Edit a cell by clicking on it.
==> The cell is blue and the row underneath goes gray.

I am having some trouble getting the swt ole classes to work the way I would like them to.  
I need to a create a non-visual OLE object in order to access other OLE objects.  

when using this constructor 
new OleControlSite(frame, SWT.NONE, clsid)
and a valid OLE clsid I get a ""SWTOLE.ERROR_CANNOT_CREATE_OBJECT"" error and the following 
return code -2147221164 from OLE.OleCreate().

Is there another way to deal with non-visual objects?

Does this return code mean anything?

Is there any way for me to get a hold of the source for the swt.dll?

If you need more info, please be specific 


KH (3/20/00 3:40:01 PM)

	The source for the SWT dll will not help you. It implements a JNI wrapper to the Windows calls. All of the 
interesting work is done in Java.  Perhaps the problem is the result of trying to create the OleControlSite using
a clsid instead of a  program ID. 

	The OLE Demo example does something similiar when it opens the common controls. See: 

			Demo.createCommonDialogControl(int index)


If this still does not help, please provide more information so we can investigate the problem further.

VI (3/31/00 8:50:01 AM)

The error  -2147221164 is the REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG error which means the specified class is not registered in the registration 
database. It also can indicate that the type of server you requested in the CLSCTX enumeration is not registered or the values 
for the server types in the registry are corrupt.  In the CLSCTX enumeration, you can specify the type of server used to 
manage the object. The constants can be CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, 
or any combination of these values. 

In SWT OLE all Controls are created with the CLSCTX value of CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER or CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER.

I am guessing that the ClearQuest control is registered as a CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER only.  To determine this, do the following:
	1) in regedit find the CLSID for ""ClearQuest.Application2"" by looking under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT -> ClearQuest.Application2 -> CLSID
	2) in regedit look at the CLSID entry HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT -> CLSID -> {the CLSID you found above}
	Under the CLSID it should list something like InProcServer32 or InProcHandler32 or LocalServer32 indicating the supported CLSCTX type.		

If the control is registered as CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER only,  is it possible to change it to 
CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER?  When we get the software to install ClearQuest I will look into this further."

GDA(4/18/00 10:13:48 PM)

	we have changed our code to call it accordingly. 

	Dirk, can you please pass the chocolate sprinkles & make the utility class be public.

	Aside:
	Even with the ""fancy capability"" described above, it isn't that special.
	It's not uncommon for composites containing a set of some enabled 
	& some disabled widgets (especially in wizards and dialogs).
	Clearly disabling and reenabling the group should return those that were originally
	disabled back to their disabled state (and should not enable them).
	Clearly there is also a need for a force enable api.
	But I guess this is moot anyways and not worth argueing about.
	
SN (4/19/00 2:58:04 PM)
	The behavior you describe exists on X/Motif.  The API call is XtSetSensitive ().
	We are modeling the Windows behavior.  The ControlEnableState class does
	more than XtSetSensitive does (ie. save and restore the old state).  It offers API
	to skip certain widgets in the tree.

	When I described it as ""fancy"", I did not mean an insult you or DB.
	
	It is not unreasonable to ""know what's going on"" and disable/enable specific
	leaf widgets in a widget tree.  It is also not unreasonable (but more work on
	Windows) to implement the behavior of XtSetSensitive ().  However, a design
	decision has been made.  If the XtSetSensitive () behavior was implemented,
	clients could not get the behavior where they didn't want the child widgets to
	be gray.  Also, we are modeling Windows behavior, not Motif.

4503,James_Moody@ca.ibm.com,2001-10-11T18:17:56Z,0,0,"A couple of things about the font dialog.

1) It calls display.getFontList() twice, once for scalable and once for non-scalable.
	This is perhaps due to confusion about what the API actually does.
	Calling with false will means I don't care whether it is scalable or not.
	In this case you will get ALL fonts returned.
	Calling with true means I only want scalable fonts.

	So in this case, the second call is redundant and gives you duplicate fonts.

2) I have many fonts on my system that don't show up in the font dialog.
	For example, adobe-courier, adobe-times, etc.
	It appears that it is actually quite a small subset of my actual fonts
	that appear in the dialog.

NOTES:

KR (03/31/00 10:55:07)
	I do have the adobe courier, times, helvetica in the font dialog on my system.
	Note that the font dialog displays the fonts sorted by character set. In order 
	to see the adobe foundry fonts, not the adobe character set fonts you have to 
	scroll down to the iso8859/Western character set.
	Perhaps it would be useful to display the system character set at the top of the 
	list?
	The only fonts that don't show up in the font dialog are the ones with slant o 
	(oblique). FontData.getStyle() only returns BOLD and ITALIC. Should there be an
	OBLIQUE slant as well? Otherwise I would have to check the slant field for ""o"" 
	directly.
	Also, if a font has both scalable and fixed size versions you can only use the 
	scalable version.

JM (3/31/00 11:16:45 AM) -
	Okay, I found courier and times... but I think that there's something bogus with character
	set selection, unless I'm just filling the fields in wrong. Adobe is not a character set, and
	if I do
		xlsfonts | grep adobe
	on my machine, it shows that all the adobe courier, times, etc. fonts have the iso8859 character
	set. Similarly, FontData returned from Display.getFontList() for courier have the iso8859 character
	set filled in. How are you detecting the charset?
	
	We should consider putting the oblique style in in the future, but it's probably not critical for the
	time being. 

KR (03/31/00 12:04:20)
	I use the FontData.characterSetRegistry and prefix it with a descriptive name like Western or 
	Korean.
	If you do 
		xlsfonts | grep adobe-font
	you will get the fonts listed below. It's bogus that X has fonts with an ""adobe"" character set
	but there's nothing we can do about it.

JM (03/31/00 14:44:37) - I understand. It would probably be less confusing for the user if the system 
	character set is at the top.

JM (5/9/00 8:27:54 AM) - Just a note. The way you do it now (i.e. ""know"" about certain character
sets and print them nicely - ""isoxxxx (Western)"" makes it less confusing. I don't think anything
necessarily needs to be done about this.

	Ok, I wrote the sample code for you.  Why couldn't you write this simple code?

	*** NOTE you will need to change the GIF to one that you can see or the code will fail ***

Image image = new Image (null,
""q:\\common\\team\\steve\\dev-win\\ide\\program\\va.gif"");
Shell shell = new Shell ();
Table table = new Table (shell, SWT.MULTI | SWT.FULL_SELECTION);
TableColumn c0 = new TableColumn (table, 0);  c0.setWidth (200);
TableColumn c1 = new TableColumn (table, 0);  c1.setWidth (200);
table.setLinesVisible (true);
for (int i=0; i<32; i++) {
	TableItem item = new TableItem (table, 0);
	item.setText (new String [] {""Item "" + i, ""Item "" + i});
	item.setImage (new Image [] {image});
//	item.setImage (new Image [] {image, null});
}
shell.open ();
table.setSize (400, 400);

	If you only set the first image, then no space is left for the image in the second
	column.  If you set the image in the second column to null or any image, space
	will be left in the second column.

	This is not a bug.  This is just what Windows does.

I have provided a workaround in the task list, so we don't need the fix for
beta. Apparently, if you set an image on a TableItem, even if that image is
null, table will reserve space for image in that column. I have subclassed
JFace TableViewerColumn and provided my implementation of 'updateItem' in
which I only set text. I can safely do this for a number of TaskList
columns because I know they will display only text (description, file,
line).

I marked the class and the code with UIHackFinder.fixPR for future
reference.

String s="""";
for( int i =0;i<30;i++ )

Display display = shell.getDisplay();

    This bug only appears when text is wider than the display. I'm guessing 
	the ""Missing lines"" equate to the height of the horizontal scroll bar rounded 
    to the next line. 

    You must have a horizontal scroll bar.

    A setText() anywhere else fixes the bug unless

some that are either adjacent to or close to the ""hot spot""--when I move the mouse out
of the ""hot spot"" I don't receive the SWT.MouseMove message to SetCursor(null).

If the child window asks for the cursor from the parent window (the one 
containing the ""hot spot""), then the child window receives the cursor loaded
in the parent window--say the West-East resize arrow--instead of the default
cursor for the child window.

A solution may be to listen for SWT.MouseMoves on the child windows 
(all of them, recursively), but if a child window adds a window to itself
without telling us, the parent, then we won't know to track movements on
this new window, leaving us where we started.

It looks like Table widget is 'eating' one vertical row of pixels i.e. images start at -1,0 not 0,0. This
causes them to be visually shifted to the left. Notified KH.

JM (5/26/00 11:46:49 AM)
	There are two separate issues here, so I'll address them both
	1) The icons in the task view are not centered. This is platform behaviour. The OS left-justifies all
	icons in table columns. There is nothing we can do to center them.
	2) The icons have a vertical column of pixels eaten by the table widget. This is the fault of the OS.
	When you ask for lines in the table, windows takes the space for the line out of what would otherwise
	be where your icon is, and neglects to shift the icon over to the right to compensate for this. The
	exception to this appears to be the first column, in which there is a fixed-width 2-pixel margin to the left
	of the image - this behaviour may be dependent on the OS or comctl version in use.

	The workaround for this behaviour is to ensure that the GIF has an extra pixel column on its left size,
	and to ensure that the column is the correct size so that the image appears to be centered (when in
	actuality it is left-justified).

This is a consequence of JFace modification of TableViewer where they decided to
stop auto-adjustment of table columns on resize. More information can be obtained
from JFace/SWT teams. I remember something about 'recursive death' on table
resize.

Bottom line: auto-resize must be part of TableViewer. Task list should not
implement it.

Moving to JFUIF

DB (5/30/00 9:37:21 AM)
	We had an implementation in JFace for this. Due to some problems with native widgets
	under Windows we had to remove the code. The related SWT PRs are:

	1FT1OI7: SWT:WINNT - Strange TableEditor behavior 
	1FT1A65: SWT:Linux - Need API to disable table's resize behavior when resizing table column 

	Moving to SWT. PR can not be fixed by JFace unless SWT fixes the above PRs.

SN (5/30/00 10:02:41 AM)
	Thanks.  It's not a problem in the native widgets.  When you resize the columns
	in a table, the table can resize in order to hide and show scroll bars.  This correctly
	causes a recursive resize callback and application code needs to handle this case,
	otherwise the application can cause recursive resize death.

DB (5/30/00 5:51:13 PM)
	We handled the recursive resize death problem properly in JFace. The problem I am taking about
	was the flickering. The was caused because:

	- the table widget shows scroll bars when the user shrinks the table.
	- after that (now the scroll bars are visible) the widget generates a resize event.
	- JFace reacts on the resize event by making some columns smaller. Now the scroll bars disappear again which causes
	  flickering.
	- Furthermore we tried to define a minimum width for a table column which also introduces a lot of flickering since
	  the native widget doesn't support a minimun width for a column. As a result the column first shrinks and on the resize
	  event JFace resizes the column to the minimum width.

	What I have asked for in the PRs was a possibility to suppress the table's resize behaviour. So instead of showing scroll
	bars the table should simply clip the right most / left most column. 

SN (5/30/00 1:34:43 PM)
	I would suggest creating the table without scroll bars but this is not currently supported by Microsoft.
	The table flickers because you ask it to do things that cause redraws.  Did you try using setRedraw ()
	to collapse all of the redraws into one?  Wish I could help more.

PaletteData would be slower (have to convert all those Color objects to ints), 
and accessing colors in the PaletteData would be slower (have to change back 
and forth from ints to Colors when setting or getting).

So is it worth it? The idea behind the Graphics ""Data"" objects is that they 
are just used to hold the info needed for creating, accessing the fields of, 
and manipulating the ""real"" graphics objects - in this case an Image.

Really, an application should not be holding on to the ImageData or 
PaletteData, instead, they should be holding on to the Image. The Data objects 
are more of a temporary thing. You can always ask an Image for its ImageData 
and/or PaletteData if you need to manipulate something or look at something.

If this is not the case in eclipse, i.e. if eclipse is holding on to bunches 
of ImageData's or PaletteData's for some reason, can you please tell me the 
reason, and we can see if maybe the eclipse usage should be reviewed in order 
to minimize the number of objects being held.

Nick, to address the original reason that this bug was opened, did you really

NOTES:

	VI (8/28/00 4:10:21 PM)
	I have tried this example on Windows 98.  With the priorities as set above, I get the behaviour that the table selection events are not
	getting processed but this is what I would expect to happen because the UI thread has been given such a low relative priority.
	When I changed the example so that both threads have the NORM_PRIORITY thread priority, the UI events get processed regularly.
	I tried this both under J9 and JDK 1.2.2.  Is there something I am missing?

DB (8/29/00 10:21:14 AM)
	I sometimes get the behavior on my machine even if I set the priority of both threads to NORM_PRIORITY. In general I
	have the following problem with the example from above:

	- I start a thread having a display. This thread processes UI events. Lets call the thread the UI thread.
	- I start a second thread that post runnable synchronously into the UI thread. Lets call the thread the producer thread.

	Now you get the following behavior: 
		- the UI thread gets activated every time the producer thread post the runnable into the UI thread, because the
		  runnable is posted using syncExec. At this point the producer thread waits until the runnable is executed.
		- the UI thread executes the event in the method runAsyncMessages(). So the UI thread is active. After the
		  runnable is executed via the call ""look.run()""  the ""synchronized (lock)"" block is finished and a thread scheduling
		  can occur (which is very probably since most VM schedule threads after a synchronized block of after a notifyAll() 
		  call). If the producer thread gets activated then it produces a new runnable and post it synchronously into the event
		  queue.
		- This again activates the UI thread. Since it is still in the do-while(true)  loop in runAsyncMessages it removes the
		  first runnable form the message queue (and there is one since the produces thread has just created one) and executes
		  the runnable. This produces the blocking of the native UI events since the runAsyncMessages method is never left.

	The problem that I have with this behaviour is, that 
		1.) although there are native events created long before the runnables have been posted into the event queue, and 
		2.) I guarantee the activation of the UI thread by using syncExec 

	the native UI events from the native event queue get never ""worked off"" because the UI thread never leaves the 
	runAsyncMessages method. In my opinion that should not happen even if the UI thread runs on LOW_PRIORITY.

	Using asyncExec instead of syncExec doesn't change anything in general. If I use asyncExec the event thread gets activated
	from time to time and should also check in runAsyncMessages if there are new native UI events which wait for processing.

	In tool items, menu items, buttons and labels, an ampersand indicates a mnemonic
	character, i.e. one that will be underlined. In order to show an actual ampersand,
	you must escape it by using two: label.setText(""b&&b"")

Sunir Shah (5/31/00 11:29:32 AM)
   In Win32, you prefix the hot character with &. In X, you
   postfix the hot character with &. In both, you use a double
   && to show an actual ampersand. The caller should escape
   the string to be ""b&&b"", possibly with a helper method:

	The clients (e.g. the desktop) should not have to alter the message being
	passed into the progress bar.
	They literally just say ""I want you to show this message"" somehow.
	The client doesn't need/care to know that its a label that shows it and as a result
	of that certain things need to be escaped.
	If this were done every single call to progress would have to be changed
	to look for any special characters.
	Moving to JFUIF for comment

EG (6/3/00 11:42:00 PM)
	It is surprising that labels also do mnemonic processing. However this makes
	sense for providing mnemonic support for check boxes. There the label is
	where the mnemonic is shown.
	
	However, I don't think that the mnemonic pre-processing should be in JFace.
	It is platform specific (you are lucky that it is the same on X and Win) but mnemonic escaping
	could be different on a future SWT platform. 
	I Suggest that SWT gives a style bit to force plain labels where no
	mnemonic processing should be done. 

AW (05.06.00 10:11:54)
	Style bit for SWT Label is OK, but Label is implementation detail of ProgressMonitor.
	So clients shouldn't know that JFace uses Label.

AW (05.06.00 11:15:16)
	Fixed in 129 for all cases where a Label is used as an implementation detail:
	Added method com.ibm.jface.util.Utilities.escapeMetaCharacters(String).

	One solution could be to disallow user-specified font sizes (i.e., ones that are not listed).
	The problem does not happen if the font is not scaled.

KR (6/2/00 8:45:49 PM)
	I noticed that the adobe courier 13 font I was using is available as both scalable and 
	non-scalable. Ie. xlsfonts lists one medium-r-normal-0-0-0-0-m-0-iso8859-1 and then
	medium-r-normal-12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1 
	medium-r-normal-14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 
	What happens when I ask SWT for an adobe courier 13? I would expect Motif to use the 
	scalable font and not to try and scale the non-scalable font. What happens if I ask for a 
	13 point font and there's neither a scalable version of the font nor a fixed size font of that 
	size? Is it allowed to do that in Motif?
	I'm asking because I let users enter the font size in the FontDialog and don't check 
	whether the font is actually scalable or available in that exact size.

JM (06/29/00 %r)
	If you ask for a 13 point font and there is neither a 13-point non-scalable font nor a
	scalable font, you get a default font (fixed) which is ugly, so there is likely a need
	to check this case in the font dialog.

	However, the problem still exists, as choosing a scalable font in any size is a valid
	thing to do. Investigating.

JM (07/04/00 11:32:51)
	This appears to be a bug in the platform; other than changing the string in setText(), which

The Table cell editors are the wrong colour, the empty columns and rows are the wrong colour and the

why it is wrong.

The [+]/[-] icon is the wrong colour - this I draw once and re-use so I can understand why it is the wrong colour.

Note: The colour is only mismatched if you change the colours while the application is running.  If you close the application and
reopen, it the colours are correct.

1. Open an ole editor in the desktop.
2. Click on the navigator.
3. Click on the editor.
4. Hit delete.  

Result: Focus indication for the desktop ( black border ) is still navigator.  
However, platform focus is in the editor.  Hence, delete is performed by
the navigator even though editor has focus.  This is VERY BAD.
See 1FVXDST: ITPUI:ALL - severe - Delete key is not redirected to editor

Cause: The desktop is not aware that focus has been handed to
the ole control ( or more specifically, a window within the ole control ). 
There is
currently no way in SWT to hook this event.

Solution: Veronika says we need a hook to listen to FocusIn events on the ole 
control. 
This hook can be used to update the focus variable in the desktop.

NOTES:

VI (6/6/2000 12:02:13 PM)
	Unfortunately, ActiveX does not have a standard way for the Control or 
Document to let the container know when
	it has gained or lost the focus.

	There is a method IOleControlSite.OnFocus but this only gets called 
when the Control (does not apply to documents) changes
	from the activate to the inactive state or vice versa.  This is not 
sufficient.

	Some of the things we could do:
	1) Change the navigator code such that it does not actually perform the 
Delete action if it does not have the focus:

			ResourceViewer::public void doDelete(final Window 
context) {

				Control control = getControl(null);
				if (control == null || !control.isFocusControl
()) return;
				...
			}

		This covers the one particular scenario but there can be many 
others.  Also, the user will hit the delete key and nothing will
		happen.
	
	2) Modify the HPBCTL control to send a special event whenever it gets 
focus.  The PageDesigner would then have to listen for this
		special event and when it is received, call requestFocus() on 
itself.

		This would solve the problem for the HPBCTL Control but there 
would still be a problem with Word, Excel, Internet Explorer, 
		DHTML Control (used in ActiveX Example).

	3) The OLE Container is notified of mouse down events.  We could 
perform a requestFocus on each mouse down event.

		Unfortunately, there are other ways in which an ActiveX Control 
can get the focus so it would not cover all cases
		and also it would case extra requestFocus calls to occur 
because we would not know if this were the first time the mouse 
		was clicked.

	4) Change the framework so that it is not dependent on the FocusIn 
event.

NOTES:

JM (07/04/00 11:17:03)
	We noticed this behaviour in WordPad, it seems to be a feature of the rich text control.
	How important is this? Does it cause the breakpoint indicators or other markers to fail?

KR (7/7/00 10:30:40 AM)
	See 1FX8BHZ. All that happens is that people loose their source position and have to
	scroll and find the old code location again - a major annoyance until you learn not to make 
	the scroll bars go away.

SN (7/13/00 10:25:49 AM)
	We have tracked this down to a bug in Windows that occurs when ES_DISABLENOSCROLL
	is used  with the RichText.  When this style is not set, the text widget scroll bars appear
	and disappear as necessary (like the List widget).  The bug cannot be reproduced in
	Wordpad.exe because they do not set this style.

	We set this style bit to be consistent with the plain text widget and because people
	expect the scroll bars in a text widget to be static.  We could not set this bit, but we
	would need to do lots of testing to make sure nothing subtle breaks.

Resize the toolbar so that only part of the combo box is visible.

"
4533,carolynmacleod4@gmail.com,2002-05-22T22:38:36Z,8,0,"I have a couple of observations and questions for you.

1) I believe that the first type of cheese mentioned (""the line below the combo 
box is all broken"") is no longer a problem - I can't see it any more.

2) If I use 16 x 16 icons, the vertical line cheese (a separator behind the 
combo) does not show up because the combo is the same height as the icons. (I 
don't know if that helps, because maybe you need to have 24 x 32 icons, but I 
just thought I'd mention it).

3) I agree that the wrap behavior is unfortunately not correct. The toolbar 
thinks that the item is a separator, so the toolbar doesn't think it needs to 
wrap until the next icon to the left wraps.

4) Eclipse now uses CoolBars instead of ToolBars. I believe that if you put 
your combo into a CoolBar, this fixes all of your problems, because:
a) There is no such thing as ""wrap"" any more - CoolItems can be repositioned by 
the user.
b) There does not seem to be any more cheese or anything - I will send you a 
little example that shows this.

So please let us know if the latest stable build of Eclipse (called F1) works 
for you, and if you are happy with having CoolBars instead of ToolBars.

I found no Interface in com.ibm.swt.events for listening to when a child Control is added to a Composite.
What is the workaround?

SN (3/2/01 2:20:45 PM)
	Added DCR to title.

CM (3/10/01 12:18:54 PM)
	Talked to SN, and at this time we are merely speculating as to why they might need this.
	Usually, an application knows when a child has been added, but if that is not the case (i.e. a framework), then:
		1) If a new child is added before the shell is opened, you can catch it in the initial resize,
			or maybe in shellActivated, or focusGained, or paint, if any of those is more convenient.
		2) If a new child is added when the shell is already open, whoever has added the child will
			typically have to force a relayout and either recompute the composite's or shell's size
			and call setSize/setBounds or just call pack. Since either of these forces a resize event
			and probably a repaint as well, the application can tell that a child has been added simply
			by keeping track of the children.

	Having said that, we suppose it is still possible that this feature could be added if it is really needed.
	McQ to get more info on why they need this, and if they still do, so that we can decide whether or not
	to implement it for this release.

at a Windows Scrollbar,
	it has a small checkerboard pattern of White and System.ControlColor.

	To achieve this in SWT, we would need some type of pattern (I believe 
this is called a Brush)
	that can be set and will affect all GC operations afterwards.  Windows, 
I believe, supports an
	8x8 bit pattern, maybe other sizes as well.  There are many other uses

	drawing an approximation of a drop shadow, since transparent colors

NOTES:
	CM (11/23/00 3:43:57 PM)
		You currently can't do a pattern paint.

		For your example of a scrollbar, the following example code may

		PaletteData palette = new PaletteData(new RGB[] {
			new RGB(white.getRed(), white.getGreen(), white.getBlue
()),
			new RGB(shadow.getRed(), shadow.getGreen(), 
shadow.getBlue())});
		
		int width = 18; // your scrollbar width
		int height = 200; // your scrollbar height
		ImageData imageData = new ImageData(width, height, 1, palette);
		for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
			for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
				if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
					imageData.setPixel(x, y, 1);
				} else {
					imageData.setPixel(x, y, 0);
				}
			}
		}

		shell.setSize(width + 20, height);
		shell.setBackground(white); // to see the image more easily
		shell.open();
		Image image = new Image(display, imageData);
		GC gc = new GC(shell);
		gc.drawImage(image, 10, 0);
		gc.dispose();
		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
		}
		
		image.dispose();

TRH (11/27/2000 11:02:32 AM)
	I have a question about this workaround.  Is ImageData Platform 
Specific?
	I was hesitant to create Palettes and ImageData since it might not work 
on all platforms.
	Maybe Indexed Images (above) ARE cross-platform.  What about True-
color, RGB vs. GBR, etc.
	Also, I would probably statically cache this Image rather than create 
it and dispose it.  Are
	there any problems doing that?

TRH (1/17/2001 9:16:42 AM)
We will
	need the ability to Tile an Image in a GC.  The region for tiling may 
be Non-rectangular:
		<HTML>
			<B bgImage = ""tile.gif"">
				Some text <BR>
				Some more text
			</B>
		</HTML>

	This is one of Many features that is required to properly render HTML.  
Another would be transparency.

CM (2/5/01 9:50:00 PM)
	ImageData and PaletteData are NOT platform-specific. They are device-
independent
	data classes. Transparency is supported in ImageData.

SN (2/5/01 6:39:16 PM)
	No plans to do this at this time.

TRH (4/19/2001 10:12:39 AM)
	Sorry for getting off the subject of 8x8 brush patterns.  By 
transparency in HTML, I meant
	transparency of a layer, which can contain HTML.  While transparency is 
supported for Image,
	we would need it for drawString(), drawLine(), etc."

		Of course there is a better way than building a collection of shells simply to ask for it's length

	DB (7/17/00 10:05:25 AM)

		to SWT than to JFace. So adding the method would simplify code in JFace.

	SN (7/17/00 12:08:05 PM)
		Fine, but there is no OS call in any operating system that answers the top level shell count.
		If SWT is to remain a thin layer on the OS, then we shouldn't be adding convenience API.

	DB (7/21/00 11:37:01 AM)
		I think it should be very simple for SWT to maintain an open shell count, since a shell can only
		be created for a given display. The current implementation in JFace is based on convention (whenever
		you create a shell you have to increment that count) and is therefore susceptible for errors.

	because these two PRs may conflict.

CM (3/28/01 5:09:33 PM)
	We investigated using the Windows ""state image"" feature in Table, but this is already being used by
	checkboxes if the Table is created with check style. It would also mean that we would have to provide
	platform-specific public API on Table to allow TableTree class to set/get state images. So we decided
	against this.

	VI is going to investigate merging the [+]/[-] images with the user's image. We would try to write it
	in such a way that only those who actually put an image in the first column would have to pay for
	the added slowness. We suspect there may be issues such as background color/transparency
	problems, hit test problems, selection highlight problems, and cheese problems, but we will have
	to try it first before we know for sure.

VI (4/4/2001 10:41:59 AM)
	Two major issues which prevent us from merging the [+]/[-] with the user's image and using the normal first column image:
	1) Images of different sizes can be added to the control, however the size of the image displayed in the associated 
        Windows Common Control will be constrained to the size of the first image added to the ImageList.
		Images for all columns are added to the same ImageList and therefore must have the exact same height and WIDTH.
		This makes merging the +/- and the first column image have impact on every image in the TableTree
	2) There is a limit to how may images I can cram in the ImageList.  Having potentially 3 per row I think will quickly exceed the limit.

VI (4/4/2001 05:20 PM)

	We have a PR that requests support for an image in the first column of a TableTree and I believe that you
	are the prime requestor.

	I have tried to make this work and below is the best I can do.  As you can see, there is a limitation on the
	underlying native widget which is that all images in the TableTree must have the exact same height and width.
	Consequently, when I leave enough room to merge the +/- image with the image you wish to show in the first column,

	It is my opinion that the current TableTree can not be made to work any better than this.  If this is not
	adequate for your use, the only alternative is to write a custom widget that does this and does not
	use the native widget.  Writing a full custom widget is not trivial.  It will probably require a month or
	two and will probably not give all the capability that is present in native List or Tree widgets (just
	because there are a lot of subtle things going on there and I won't have time to get them all).  I need
	to know if I should commence with a custom widget.  Also, as I have other responsibilities, Mike and I will
	have to discuss which of them will be set aside before I can do this work.

DESCRIPTION:
Is there a way to create a Composite child window if we have just the
parent Composite's window handle?  This would provide another level of
flexibility in window handling.

<KH>
What are you really trying to do in this case. There is no portable API for
doing this.

There may be a platform specific answer for this but I would like to
try the exact case here before proposing a solution to the customer.
</KH>

<CL>  [Cheng-Yee Lin]
The window creation process involves multiple components, say 3 of them.
The first component creates a Composite window that serves as a ""frame"" and
passes the window to the second component.  Then, the second component
may ""fill in the content"" by creating a ""true"" child window, or it may
create another ""frame"" by creating a Composite window as the child window
and
pass the actual ""content filling"" to the third component.
</CL>

<GDA>
I'm not 100% clear here because it sounds like either they
1)	Want to know how to create a composite inside a composite - which 
should be possible
2) Or they are cheating and want to use the actual OS handles?

SWT any idea here?
</GDA>


NOTES:

	McQ (16/10/2000 10:27:06 AM) -
		As KH indicated, there is currently no API for creating child 
windows given
		only the handle for the parent. Indeed, it's not clear why you 
would want this
		given the example provided above, since the obvious 
implementation would
		be to simply pass around the composites, rather than their 
handles. [NOTE:
		It's entirely possible that I just didn't understand the 
example provided. If so
		please advise.]

		The only situation where you would actually *need* to be 
creating children
		given only the handle is when that handle was created by some 
external
		application (i.e. not SWT code).

		We have been asked to support this for the specific case of 
widgets
		created with AWT/Swing, and we have fully functional example 
code which
		does this in our development stream. When this is made 
available, it will
		include the ability to create a child widget given only a 
handle, but the *type*
		of this child widget may be constrained (i.e. you may need a 
particular widget,
		say ""EmbeddedComposite"" between your SWT layout and the 
containing
		AWT widget).

		There are several additional caveats:
			- this may not be available on all platforms. For 
example,
			  on linux/motif the AWT implementation uses the Motif 
libraries in a
			  way which is incompatible with SWT. It's not clear if 
we will be able
			  to work around this yet.
			- the mechanism is intended to provide interoperability 
between AWT/Swing
			  and SWT *only*. That is, it will likely not work 
given a handle created by
			  an arbitrary wad of C code.
			- the application code which uses the embedded SWT 
widget(s) needs to
			  respect the SWT event/threading model, so for 
example, messages sent
			  from threads other than the one which created the SWT 
widgets need to
			  be wrapped with Display.syncExec(...).

We are working on a script debugger. A script is evaluated on a new thread
(not the ui thread). This is to allow  the use of the debug ui to cancel or
pause a script, while the script is running.

In general, scripts will have access to java objects the are based on SWT
widgets.

We have run into an issue that an SWT widget cannot be accessed on a thread
other than the thread it was created on.

To solve this problem, we are faced with wrapping many of our SWT accesses
with code similar to the following:

    // we saved 'display' during init on the ui thread
    if(display.getThread().equals(Thread.currentThread()))
    {
        // access SWT widget
    }
    else
    {
        display.asyncExec(new Runnable()
        {
            public void run()
            {
                //  access SWT widget
            }
        });
    }


We are wondering why can't SWT do this internally? Do you have any
suggestions for us?

NOTES:

	McQ (30/11/2000 8:53:44 AM) -
		The underlying philosophy of SWT is to make available the 
capabilities provided
		by the operating systems it is hosted on, without attempting 
to ""sugar coat"" 
		those facilities in ways which cause performance or consistancy 
problems. 

		<em>
		No operating system that we support allows applications to make 
widget calls
		between real o/s threads, and we do not either.
		</em>

		Leaks and redraw problems are 
		the *most* often sited reasons why developers claim that real-
world applications can
		not be built with AWT/Swing. 

		SWT applications are fast, leak free (if the application code 
is), and consistantly
		redraw properly because of our decision to model the thread 
interaction explicitely.
		This has been proven both by internal testing and by external 
customers.

	McQ (30/11/2000 9:08:01 AM) -
		W.r.t. the code you provided, I wanted to point out that you 
are going to be getting
		different behavior in the ""same thread"" versus ""different 
thread"" cases with the code
		as it stands. For the same thread case, you would be doing 
the ""access SWT widget""
		stuff immediately, but for the different thread case, the code 
will run some time
		later if you use asyncExec rather than syncExec.

		Also, I'm not sure if you have checked the performance 
characteristics or not, but I
		should point out that it is always safe (and relatively fast 
(modulo the Runnable 
		creation)) to call a syncExec call from the u/i thread, since 
it simply runs the code
		without thread switching. Perhaps your code could be written 
simply as...

		// we saved 'display' during init on the ui thread
		display.syncExec( new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				//  access SWT widget
			}
		});

		Of course, if performance is critical, then you *would* 
probably want to have code
		which looked like your code above. Note that in this case, you 
would probably also
		want to cache the result of ""display.getThread()"", since this 
is guaranteed not to
		change for the lifetime of the display.

Here's the test case:

	import java.awt.event.*;
	
	public class MenuFrameTest extends Object
	{
	        public static void main (String[] args)
	        {
	                final Frame frame = new Frame (""Menu Test"");
	                
	                MenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar ();
	                Menu menu = new Menu (""Frame"");
	                MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem (""Close"");
	                
	                ActionListener listener = new ActionListener ()
	                {
	                        public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent event)
	                        {
	                                frame.dispose ();
	                                System.exit (0);
	                        }
	                };
	                
	                menuItem.addActionListener (listener);
	                menu.add (menuItem);
	                menuBar.add (menu);

	                frame.show ();
	        }
	}

This problem can also be reproduced without adding a MenuItem to the Menu or setting the Frame's bounds:

	import java.awt.*;
	
	public class MenuFrameTest extends Object
	{
	        public static void main (String[] args)
	        {
	                Frame frame = new Frame (""Menu Test"");
	                MenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar ();
	                Menu menu = new Menu (""Frame"");
	                menuBar.add (menu);         
	                frame.setMenuBar (menuBar);
	                frame.show ();
	        }
	}

	Moving to SWT ... also changing OS to ALL

	The SWT team is going to have to own a file called <some SWT package>/jxeLink.rules (case sensitive).  This file
	contains jxeLink reduction rules.  There should be one of these files in a win32 specific package, in a Photon
	package, etc. etc.  It may be that there could be a common one if any reduction rules are needed for the 
	platform independent code (seems unlikely to me).  mcq is basically familiar with this concept, as it was done
	for the jcl as well, but as a separate file instead of as a resource in the jar.  It >really< needs to be in a resource
	in a jar, or it's going to be impossible for users.

	When in applet mode, both the window callbacks and input proc callbacks 
are being called into from
	(potentially), the PtMainLoop() that the plugin is running.  ie, there 
is no Java code calling these
	methods, or any C code that we control at all.  This causes a problem 
when an exception is
	thrown, as it goes right by all the methods in the frame, expecting 
someone down low to
	handle it.  Noone there to do it.  

	I would like to see the following sort of code added for both the 
inputProc and windowCallback,
	so that I can at least diagnose exceptions.  Currently, I have to sort 
of guess that  	an exception occurred and that's why my syncExec() never 
returns"".  I can stick a breakpoint in
	Throwable's constructor and catch it that way


int windowProc (int handle, int data, int info) throws Throwable {
	try {
		Widget widget = WidgetTable.get (handle);
		if (widget == null) return OS.Pt_CONTINUE;
		return widget.processEvent (data, info);
	}
	catch (Throwable e) {
		if (embedded) e.printStackTrace();
		throw e;
	}
}

	Also, I had patched runAsyncMessages() before, as when the lock threw 
an exception,
	it never bothered to wake up the sender.  I think it is perfectly valid 
to do this.  ie, 
	change the code as follows:

boolean runAsyncMessages () {
	if (messagesSize == 0) return false;
	do {
		RunnableLock lock = removeFirst ();
		if (lock == null) return true;
		synchronized (lock) {
			try {							
			// ---- added this line
				lock.run ();
			}							
				// ---- added this line
			finally {						
		// ---- added this line
				lock.notifyAll ();
			}							
				// ---- added this line
		};
	} while (true);
}

	I don't know, maybe not.  I guess at this point the readAndDispatch() 
thread would be
	dead.  However, in the applet case, I think everything would be fairly 
clean.  Might get
	some mouse problems if exceptions did get thrown, but it would be worth 
it.

NOTES:

PJM (12/7/00 12:28:23 AM)
	I'd really like to get the try{} finally{} in runAsyncMessages, as I 
just noticed a thread
	blocked on a Runnable that was long gone, and it was tying up my AWT 
Event Queue.
	Here are my current versions:

int inputProc (int data, int rcvid, int message, int size) {
	if (!embedded) return OS.Pt_CONTINUE;

	try {	
		runDeferredEvents ();
		runAsyncMessages ();
	}
	catch (Throwable e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}
	
	return OS.Pt_CONTINUE;
}

boolean runAsyncMessages () {
	if (messagesSize == 0) return false;
	do {
		RunnableLock lock = removeFirst ();
		if (lock == null) return true;
		synchronized (lock) {
			try {
				lock.run ();
			}
			finally {
				lock.notifyAll ();
			}
		};
	} while (true);
}

int windowProc (int handle, int data, int info) {
	Widget widget = WidgetTable.get (handle);
	if (widget == null) return OS.Pt_CONTINUE;
	
	if (!embedded) return widget.processEvent (data, info);
	
	try {
		return widget.processEvent (data, info);
	}
	catch (Throwable e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
		return OS.Pt_CONTINUE;
	}
	
}

SSQ/SN (12/7/00 4:30:00 PM) -
	We don't think adding debug statement in the code is right. We plan to 
do
	something like the following:

1) Add this field to com.ibm.swt.widgets.RunnableLock

	Throwable throwable;

2) Change these methods in com.ibm.swt.widgets.Display

public void syncExec (Runnable runnable) {
	if (isValidThread ()) {
		if (runnable != null) runnable.run ();
		return;
	}
	if (runnable == null) {
		wake ();
		return;
	}
	RunnableLock lock = new RunnableLock (runnable);
	synchronized (lock) {
		addLast (lock);
		wake ();
		boolean interrupted = false;
		while (!lock.done ()) {
			try {
				lock.wait ();
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				interrupted = true;
			}
		}
		if (interrupted) {
			Thread.currentThread ().interrupt ();
		}
************ ADDED  ************
		if (lock.throwable != null) {
			SWTError.error(SWT.ERROR_UNSPECIFIED, lock.throwable);
		}
***************************************
	}
}

boolean runAsyncMessages () {
	if (messagesSize == 0) return false;
	do {
		RunnableLock lock = removeFirst ();
		if (lock == null) return true;
		synchronized (lock) {
*************** ADDED ***************
			try {
***************************************
				lock.run ();
*************** ADDED ***************
			} catch (Throwable t) {
				lock.throwable = t;
			}
***************************************
			lock.notifyAll ();
		};
	} while (true);
}

	So that the caller of Display.syncExec() will be notified that an 
exception ocurred while
	running the syncExec runnable.

PJM (12/11/00 4:57:50 PM)
	This is going to have a new side effect of having exceptions 
transported from the UI thread as
	a rando exception, into the thread doing the syncExec() as an SWTError.

	I guess this basically solves my issue of ensuring the lock.notifyAll() 
is always run, which it
	seems like it would in this case.  It doesn't help at all with my 
desire to have debugging code
	in windowProc or inputProc though, unless I missed something.

	Given that, I don't think having a possible SWTError out of syncExec 
really helps >me<.  I
	use it all over the place, and clearly can't add execption handlers to 
it.  I can't imagine
	too many people doing this.  Besides, you will get different behaviour 
if an exception
	is thrown in your syncExec() depending if you are on the UI thread or 
not (wrapped in an
	SWTError if you aren't on UI thread, not wrapped in an SWTError if you 
are on a UI 
	thread).

	Given all this, it seems safest to just change the lock.run(); call into
		try {
			lock.run();
		}
		finally {
			lock.notifyAll();
		}

	The debugging statements in windowProc and inputProc, per my 
suggestion, only
	get used for the embedded=true case.  I don't see much harm in using 
them as is.

SSQ (3/16/01 3:55:26 PM) -
	We don't believe that just notifing the caller thread is the right 
thing to do,
	since this hides the fact that the runnable failed to run completly and 
can lead to
	things being null and other unexpected conditions in the caller code.

PJM (8/31/2001 12:02:21 PM)
	Have some code that runs in a syncExec() 
	under Voyager, and if it throws an exception, we lock up the entire 
applet
	system.

	Again, reason for this is basically that the lock is not sent notifyAll
(), so the
	thread that did the syncExec() will never wake up again.  Locked 
forever.

	Plus, because we have no Java code or C code we control that is 
basically
	calling the callin points of inputProc() et al, we actually have no 
idea that
	an exception has actually occurred.

	So, I've gone back and had to patch in this same friggin code again to
	get the customer limping.  Code added is the code to catch throwable 
and 
	print the stack trace if (embedded == true), and the movement of the
	lock.notifyAll() code to inside the finally {} block instead of outside 
of it.
	

SSQ (9/6/01 2:39:22 PM) -
	The consensus is that we will do 2 things:
		- put a ""debug flag"" into SWT to optionally allow stack traces 
to be printed.
		- cause some kind of SWTError to occur on the thread which 
called the syncExec, 
		rather than leave it hanging forever.

	Need to decide whatr is going to happen with the UI thread. Should we 
hide the exception
	from the UI thread, or not?"

------------- email from Tim deBoer --------------

Here's the problem I mentioned earlier...

I have a multiline Label in a GridLayout with another component above it.
I've set the GridData for both the composite and the Label to include
VERTICAL_ALIGN_FILL and set grabExcessVerticalSpace = true. However, no
matter what I do, the Label will only show the number of lines of text that
it has initially. For instance, if I set the text to ""line 1"" initially,
then it will never show two lines. If I set it to ""line 1\nline 2"", then it
will show two. What I'd like to be able to do is give it all of the
remaining space in the composite so that I don't need to worry if the text
may expand in the future. The current workaround is to set the initial text
to many lines (e.g. ""test\n\n\n\n\n\n"").

	Hold down the alt 'a' keys and then release 'a' key and then alt key:
		On Windows:
			Get two callbacks.  The first callback has e.character = 97, e.keyCode = 0.
			The second callback has e.character = 97, e.keyCode = 65536.
		On Linux:
			Get multiple (continuous) callbacks as keys are held down with e.character = 97, e.keyCode = 0.
			Continuous callbacks stop when 'a' key is released. After alt key is released, get a callback
			with e.character = 0, e.keyCode = 65536.

SN (2/6/01 3:51:27 PM)
	This is a very old problem.  It goes as follows.  Windows (and Motif in some cirumstances,
	on J and G platforms) does not give enough information in the ""key up"" event to find out
	the key that was pressed in ""key down"".  So, SWT saves the key that was pressed in ""key
	down"" and delivers that key in key up.

	This strategy has at least 2 problems:
		- if there is no key down (ie. it was eaten by an accelerator), then there is no key up
		- if multiple keys are held down and released, the wrong key is reported in some key ups

	No plan to fix this at this time."

have very limited functionality. For example -
we are not able to change the color or font of a property value.
We need to have visual distinction between read-only
properties and the writeable ones. For example we woud like
the read-only properties to be grayed(like disabled).
In order to do that I have implemented our own
LabelProvider, which derives from SimpleLabelProvider.
This class has the following methods:

 getLabelImage(IVisualPart, Object);
 getLabelText(IVisualPart, Object);

So, I was hoping that the VisualPart argument is actually
the table item/widget itself and I'll be able to change
it's appearance(for example it's color or font).

Unfortunately the PropertySheetViewer when updates the table
items, passes as first argument reference to itself instead to the TreeItem:
Follows excerpt from the PropertySheet code:

/*PropertySheetViewer  method*/
private void updateValue(TableTreeItem item)
{
   ...
   provider = getLabelProvider();

   String label = provider.getLabelText(this, entry);
   IImage image = provider.getLabelImage(this, entry);
   ....
}

But even if the PropertySheetViewer was passing the
TableTreeItem as first argument, that still wouldn't work,
because TableTreeItem doesn't have the needed functionality.

So, is there anything else we could do to change the color
or the font of a PropertySheet item's text?

VI (1/13/01 9:59:57 PM)
From what I can tell, they would like to be able to set the Color and/or Font 
of a single item in a TableTree.  
Correct me if I am wrong.
This is not available in the TableTree because it is not available in the Table 
(TableTree is just cake for a Table).  
This functionality is not available on the Table because Windows does not 
provide the API to do this. (I am 90% 
sure that this last statement is true and I will verify with Steve when he gets 
in).
I think this would require something like Owner Draw or implementing our own

	We have a viewer that is quite expensive to update. Therefore we don't update the viewer when
	the model has changed, but the viewer is not visible. But then, we have to update the viewer
	when it becomes visible. I have found no API in SWT to do this.

TM (21.12.2000 17:46:07)
	It seems DB hacked this into an earlier SWT version in ZRH.

DB (21.12.2000 17:56:58)
	We haven't  found any API in the Desktop / JFace either. Is there a way to track visibility of
	a viewer using JFace or Desktop mechanisms. Or at least to track the visibility of view part.

	Moved PR to Desktop since it is not clear whether this is a SWT or Desktop / JFace problem.

EG (1/9/01 11:59:32 AM)
	Lost functionality in the New Platform.
	We can tolerate a slow Type Hierarchy View to start self hosting. However, we need this
	function back in the final product.

EG (3/5/01 6:49:26 PM)
	Here is some more background.
	In the old JFace we could ask a Viewer whether it is visible or not. In addition, Viewer
	had a life cycle method becomesVisible that is called when a viewer becomes visible.
	We have leveraged this in the Java tooling to only update the type hierarchy when
	it is visible. That is, when it is invisible and we get a change notification we only
	remember that the viewer is dirty. When a viewer becomes visible and is dirty
	then we refresh it.

	This PR can be addressed either at the JFace or SWT level.
	KH please comment and move PR if needed.

KH(4/5/2001 9:13:52 AM)
	This is similiar to the activation problem. In order to guarantee that the viewer gets notified
that the visibility changes a callback on the widget is required. 
	
	McQ (05/04/2001 9:50:37 AM) -
		I'll discuss this with the team.

	McQ (05/04/2001 4:05:08 PM) -
		There *is* a callback when the widget needs to be painted (which, of course, happens
		when it becomes visible). The only problem I can see with just using this (and a bit of
		application logic to detect that it's the first occurance) is that, it happens *after* any
		drawing that the widget does itself. It's pretty easy to get around this, though.  For
		example, by having a simple composite parent which, when *it* is first painted does
		whatever updating is required on its (still invisible) children and then makes them visible.

		Given that we now are supposed to be API frozen, I'm unlikely to want to add new API
		to fix the ""lost function"" (which btw, I take issue with, since you have *not* lost function
		w.r.t. SWT).

		If we were to do something, it would have to be along the lines of an ""about to be painted""
		callback which happens *before* the widget does its own painting. Just to be clear: I'm
		not planning to do this currently.

	McQ (05/04/2001 4:18:56 PM) -
		There's another issue, however. You also want to know when the widget is _no_longer_
		visible, so you can *stop* updating it. The problem with this, is that it's impossible for
		me to detect this without a complex and fallible set of calculations on widget bounds,
		z-ordering, ancestor visibility, etc. 

		For particular cases, for example (in eclipse terms), when the desktop drops another
		view on the same area of the perspective, the best thing to do is just have the application
		tell the view it's being covered.

		Of course, we *could* do the simple hack of providing a callback on a widget when
		someone calls setVisible(), but obviously the argument against this is that, if the 
		application is calling setVisible(), then *it* can call whatever else it wants to 
		enable/disable updating.

SN (4/10/01 6:38:27 PM)
	Here is some code that does lots of work when the widget is painted.  It's a first attempt
	to use a paint listener to be lazy about filling the contents of a widget.  There are several
	things to note about the code.  The work portion includes ""list.update ()"" calls to force the
	list widget to redraw in between items.  This causes recursive paints to come in that are
	protected by the ""dirty"" flag.  Also, I didn't bother trying to abstract out the SWT calls the
	non-SWT calls use because I felt less code would be easier to understand.

	NOTE:  Most UI's make a point of spending as little time as possible painting the widget
	and the ""lazy painting"" strategy violates this general rule of thumb.  The reason for this
	rule is that the UI will appear frozen to the user while the widget paints leading him to
	believe that the application is hung or is at best, sluggish.  We've all seen UI's like this!
	However, I believe that a solution based on doing the work in a setVisible () listener
	would exhibit the same behavior.

	Please play with this example and determine this approach could be used to optimize
	your code.  Thanks.

	Leaving in the Listener and Event for now.  Email trails follow.

From Andre and Kai:

""
We thought quite a while about your arguments and subsequently we summarize 
what we think would solve almost all of the current issues. We know that most of 
those thoughts have already been around, so this is more or less an attempt to 
bring them into shape.

StyledText provides two different APIs each serving a different purpose. One is the
callback API consisting of StyledTextContent, LineStyleListener, and 
LineBackgroundListener. Its intent is to prevent any kind of state duplication. The 
other API is the stateful API which primarily should allow for the simple, minimal knowledge
requiring case. This API consist of the following methods:  setText(..),  append, 
getCharCount, getLineCount,  getLineDelimiter, getText(..), 
insert(String string),  replace(..),  getLineAtOffset, setStyleRange,
setStyleRanges, getStyleAtOffset(int offset), getStyles().

The two different APIs may not interchangeably be used which is not represented in
the API but an implementation constraint.  E.g, it's rather confusing to recognize that 
some of the stateful API does not longer work when having installed a LineStyleListener.

We believe that those two APIs should at least be separated, and even that the stateful
API is unnecessary. Thus, we vote for removing all the 13 methods which make up the
stateful API.  By  making the DefaultContent and DefaultLineStyler public the simple, 
minimal knowledge requiring case can still be covered.  Achieving the functionality originally
provided by the stateful API can then be achieved by using the default implementers and
talking to them directly. We believe that  SWT is already that demanding that forcing clients
to talk to those model components will not make them unhappy. The clients still have the 
opportunity to wrap them in their own classes.

Besides the API simplification and the clearer representation of the used concepts we
see additional benefits. E.g., the implementation of StyledText could become simpler
and more lightweight. All checks  ""if (defaultLineStyler != null)"" could be removed. 
Some defaults are no longer necessary like the allocation of a  ""new StyleRange[0]""
for every drawn line.

We are also confident that those changes would be in the good tradition of SWT to be 
as simple as possible while still being powerful.
""

McQ response:

""Traditions of simplicity"" aside, what you are proposing is that the StyledText widget have an API which 
has little in common with either Text, RichText, or even more generically any of the other SWT widgets 
(for example, List). Clearly, this is unreasonable.

I do agree that there are two different APIs. I would even be willing to consider splitting them into class 
and subclass if I could ensure that doing so did not decrease the performance of the ""stateful"" API
hide the ""stateless"" API so that it is accessible only from your world.

I believe the best version of the compromise is that, 

 - we formally identify the two different APIs, including stating that they are not interchangeable 
(note: this also says that we will maintain both)
- we clearly indicate via comments in the ""stateless"" API methods that these are intended for use 
only in situations where the more standard""statefull"" API is not powerful enough

Please understand, I believe that 90% or better of the typical uses of this widget will not require the stateless 
API, and that that API would be cumbersome to deal with in those common situations."

	but there is no way to ask the following questions:
		- is the display palette indexed or direct color
			note: isDirect != getDepth() > 8 in some cases (e.g. Xvnc)
		- how many red, green, and blue bits of resolution are supported
			(not necessarily the actual masks, and also applies to indexed modes)
			note: required when improving image quality via dithering
				instead of quantizing (usually the platform's behavior)
		- which pens does the application have access to
		- is the display local (fast) or remote (slow)

	Much of this information could be packaged up in a PaletteData perhaps.

	Moreover internally SWT makes the assumption that bit depths <= 8
	imply paletted modes.  This is particularly problematic on older
	Unix platforms such as are often found in academic environments --
	a target focus for Eclipse.  It is also a problem for Xvnc, a popular

correctly. However,
controls that normally do need a border (text, tree, table etc.) create a 
beveled (edged) border
when SWT.BORDER style is used.
This border does not fit well if one wants to maintain the 'flat' look. 
However, without
using the BORDER style, the widget bounds are hard to spot, particularly if 
they are
on the background of the same color (i.e. white).

I have seen applications that use 'flat' controls throughout. I need the 'flat' 
look so that I can set widget backgrounds
to the canvas-like background (i.e. white) and create more of a 'Web' form
appearance (as opposed of a classic dialog appearance). We want to
use widgets configured this way in the editor area, and don't want
to simply 'fold the dialog' by using regular gray controls with beveled borders.

Is it possible to use one-pixel 'foreground' border for these control when both
SWT.BORDER and SWT.FLAT are set? I tried to add paint listener to a Text
control and paint one pixel rectangle at the bounds, but nothing happened
(it was probably clipped).

NOTES:

VI (29/01/2001 9:43:22 AM)
	The SWT.FLAT style is currently only supported for Buttons and Toolbars.

SN (2/6/01 6:19:44 PM)
	Not quite sure what the flat look that DG wants should look like for 
every
	possible widget.  Is it the old Windows 3.11 look where the background
	color is white and the borders black and are a single pixel wide?

	Also, not sure what to do on the other platforms.  For example, how do
	I decide what a flat look is on Motif?  There was never a version of 
Motif
	that was ""flat"" so I hate to arbitrarily decide what this means.

DG (2/15/2001 1:33:28 PM)
	For most of the widgets, FLAT means to refrain from painting beveled
	borders to achive '3D' effect, as already works for buttons. For
	Text controls, it would mean drawing a 1-pixel rectangle using
	the widget's foreground color. For Item-based widgets 
	(Tree, Table, List etc.), FLAT would mean drawing a 1-pixel
	rectangle using the color that is also used to draw 
	grid lines (in table). I am sure that all Windows widgets
	can be configured to draw simple (1-pixel) border instead
	of 3D border. 

	With Motif, the effect described above should also be
	easy to set. I am not exactly sure about the details,
	but I beleive that something can be done with
	XmNborderWidth and XmNborderPixmap resources.
	As for widgets drawn by EWT (missing in the Motif
	toolkit) it is even easier, since we are drawing them
	anyway.

	Mind you, I am not asking for a completely new widget set
	or a different 'look and feel' as in JFC, just different 
	visual style i.e. lack of 3D border.
	The goal is to make widgets fit better in the form-like environment.
	The lack of 3D effect makes them look 'flush' with the document
	and the overall user experience is that both text and
	widgets are part of the document.

    - There are some issues with the choices of widgets for the motif 2.1 
implementation of SWT 
        - XmContainer widget to do tree displays 
        - Container Widget/Icon Gadget -  display tabular and tree-structured

Can you elaborate on the above & what you mean by ""issues with the choices of 
widgets""

<DN>
Motif 2.1 has new widgets. Are you making use of the new widgets? We noticed 
that
the combo box widget has been changed in SWT to use the newer motif widget. Our
resident motif guy wants OTI to be aware of the new widgets. That's all.
</DN>
 
<GDA-2>
Ah, now I understand the nature of the question.
Yes we are aware of the new widgets. 
We believe we're actually using the Spinbox for the Motif example of ""how to 
build new widgets using natives"" in 
the custom widget doc we are writing.  We are looking at the other widgets, but 
haven't made 
decisions about whether or not to use them. At the moment this is not a 
priority 1.

			public Font getSystemFont ()

	McQ (28/02/2001 9:14:56 AM) -
		I don't understand the relationship between fonts and arrays of 
font data. Is
		this what we use to handle the ""J fonts are built out of 
multiple real fonts on X""
		problem? If so, then we need to support it properly. That is, 
the constructor which
		takes an array of font datas should exist, and result in a font 
which uses them
		all.

	CM (2/28/01 10:28:50 AM)
		Yes, this is how we represent ""multiple fonts in a J font"" on X.
		A single Font object will suffice for most things (setting into 
widgets, etc), but if
		someone needs the FontData then they can ask for it.  The 
orthogonal operation
		(starting with a bunch of FontData objects and creating a Font 
out of it) is actually
		quite rare, and while I agree that it should be provided some 
day for completeness,
		I would argue that it is about a priority 4, now that we have 
(I believe) a satisfactory
		solution to KH's immediate problem.

		Another argument for moving to inactive for now is that anyone 
who does this
		- i.e. creates a Font (actually an XFontList) out of a group of 
FontData's -
		must really really know what they are doing. Besides the 
obvious fact that they
		could completely mess up and have fonts that clobber each 
other's character sets,
		the Font they create will not be identical to one that they got 
an array of FontData from.
		For example, if we have a J Font called font1 (created by name, 
say ""Mincho""), then:
			FontData font1Data[] = font1.getFontData();
			Font font2 = Font(display, font1Data);
			if (font2 == font1) { ...
				They would never be ==. I am not positive that 
I can guarantee equality, either,
				but I would obviously try. The problem is the 
ordering of the fontdata in the array.
			}

		One last reason why I would like to move this to inactive for 
now is that, while it would
		not be difficult to implement, this feature would be a bear to 
test. This includes testing
		with X ""font aliases"", which would probably make it impossible 
to ever guarantee equality.

	Not quite sure how to fix this.  On Windows, WM_SETREDRAW sets the WS_VISIBLE bits
	for the HWND without actually hiding the window and issueing the paints necessary to
	redraw the area where the widget used to be.  This is internal Windows magic because
	anyone else cannot touch WS_VISIBLE without causing a redraw.   The WS_VISIBLE bits
	are also used by ShowWindow () to show and hide the window.  The problem is that the
	same bits are used by both calls.

	I am tempted to say ""platform behavior"" but I can see the problems that this causes.

KR (2/28/01 12:03:07 PM)
	I came across this problem when I started using the emulated Motif Table with the Windows 
	Leapfrog. All the table viewers now have a header without the table knowing about it (nobody 
	ever made it visible). This messes up the table rendering and navigation.
	I think this has to be fixed.
	If setRedraw is called with true and the window is invisible couldn't you cache the value 
	and set it when setVisible(true) is called?

SN (2/28/01 12:53:42 PM)
	I can cache values but I hate to do this because this will lead to sync bugs.  Also, Windows
	really does make the window visible using WS_VISIBLE so making it not visible might cause
	flashing.  I'd have to experiment.  The other thought I had was to ignore calls to setRedraw
	when the widget is not visible but this would mean that calls to setVisible that were issued
	between setRedraw (false)/setRedraw (true) would have to be ignored as well.

	I want to help but I'm not sure how.

SN (3/22/01 12:17:32 PM)

the clauses are one long text string.  We would like the viewer that we are

========
Split lines after spaces (i.e., wrap words). If the last remaining word on the 
line does not fit entirely wrap character based, i.e. split the word.


General Concepts
================
ContentWidthCache:
Can be used to wrap lines. Wherever ContentWidthCache.calculate is called the 
line wrapping needs to be recalculated.
Note: During resize all wrapped lines need to be reset and those that are 
visible need to be recalculated. This is different from the normal use where 
lines are only reset when they (or their styles) have changed.

StyledTextContent:
Create a wrapper that works with visual line indices.
 getOffsetAtLine(visualLine)
 visualLine getLineAtOffset()
 String getLine(visualLine)
 numVisualLines getLineCount()

Note that the original, wrapped, StyledTextContent still needs to be accessible 
for use by StyledText API (e.g., getLineCount).


Changes to StyledText
=====================
(ok) means that something is trivial or needs no change to support word wrap. 
API methods should eventually lead to one of the internal methods. 

Internal Methods
----------------
computeSize:
 Compute preferred size to show as many wrapped lines as possible. Maximum 
width == screen width followed by maximum height == screen height.

handlePaint:
 topIndex is visual, content wrapper returns visual lines for visual indices
handlePaint->drawLine->getLineBackgroundData:
 Called with visual offset & line. same as getLineStyleData below
handlePaint->drawLine->drawLineSelectionBackground:
 Change line break selection

showBidiCaret:
 Ok if content.getLineAtOffset/content.getOffsetAtLine return data based on 
visual (wrapped) lines. Will create a bidi object using the wrapped line.
showBidiCaret->showLocation:
 Ok when called with visual line indices and assuming that the top index and 
bottom index represent visual lines.
showBidiCaret->setBidiCaretLocation:
 Similar to showBidiCaret.

showCaret->getXAtOffset->textWidth->getLineStyleData:
 Called with visual line data, needs to send an event using logical line. I.e., 
needs to  convert lineOffset, lineText back to logical. Also needs to (should, 
really - we may work with leaving bogus styles in the visual line) chop off 
styles that aren't on the requested visual line.
showCaret->setCaretLocation:
 Ok, gets called with visual line


API Methods
-----------
No op:
getHorizontalIndex (return 0), getHorizontalPixel (return 0), setHorizontalIndex

getLineAtOffset
 Return logical line

getLineBackground
 Return logical line

getLocationAtOffset
 Change to use visual line.

getOffsetAtLocation->getOffsetAtX->getLineStyleData:
 See textWidth above.

redraw (ok)

redrawRange->internalRedrawRange (ok)

replaceTextRange->handleTextChanging:
 change redraw
replaceTextRange->handleTextChanged->claimBottomFreeSpace-
>setVerticalScrollOffset (ok)

setText->handleTextSet->reset
 ->calculateContentWidth:
   calculate line wrap, interact with StyledTextContent wrapper
 ->handlePaint (s.a.)

showSelection->showOffset:
 ->getXAtOffset->textWidth (s.a.)
 ->showLocation (s.a.)

4610,knut_radloff@us.ibm.com,2001-12-18T16:56:10Z,5,0,"Keyboard navigation:
We solely rely on the caret offset to position the caret on a line in the 
document.
This presents a problem in word wrap mode because the end offset of a visual 
line is the same as the start offset of the next visual line. Therefore, when 
the caret is at the end of a visual line/start of the next visual line the 
usual content.getLineAtOffset can not be used to determine the actual visual 
line the caret is on. Likewise, the caret positioning code does not have enough 
information to place the caret on the correct visual line.
There are a few options to deal with this while only introducing localized code 
changes:
1. Pass the desired line to showCaret:
The desired line is unknown in the line change example because moving down 
one line from the end of visual line 0 (e.g., offset 2) is the same
as moving down one line from the start of visual line 1 (e.g., offset 2).
A fix would be to compare the caret position. However this would need to be
done for the line change case and for the line start/end case.

2. Passing the previous caret offset to showCaret:
This does not help because moving to the line end from offset 0 results in 
the same state as moving one line down from offset 0. Yet, the desired line
is 0 in the first case and 1 in the line down case.

3. Use the caret pixel location to determine the desired line:
The caret location would need to be checked in many navigation methods and then 
the desired line would need to be passed to showCaret. In addition mouse caret 
position changes would have to handled differently because they do not call 
showCaret.

Another option is to store the caret line index in addition to the caret 
offset. This does require a new field but is otherwise straightforward with the 
least amount of code changes in the navigation methods.
Whenever the caret offset is changed the desired caret line is known or can be 
calculated using the previous caret line. The caret line can then be used in 
showCaret and setCaretLocation to override the line returned by 
content.getLineAtOffset. The required code changes are fairly localized. 
There's a small risk to this change in that the caret line may not be set 
correctly. However, this shouldn't be a problem with sufficient testing."
4610,knut_radloff@us.ibm.com,2001-12-20T21:01:21Z,6,0,"Enabling word wrap during widget startup:
Currently, when word wrap is enabled while the widget hierarchy is being 
initialized (i.e., the client area width is 0) all lines are wrapped to the 
first character only to be rewrapped to the client area width when the widget 
is first made visible.
There has to be *some* initial state because the WrappedContent has to answer 
valid values for the implemented StyledTextContent API. We could deal with this 
by testing whether the client area width is 0 and if it is forward all 
StyledTextContent API calls to the real (logical) StyledTextContent 
implementor. This would mean that the initial state is ""infinite client area 
width"".

We did not do a performance pass. The resize performance is a little slow when 
word wrap is on and a large number of lines are wrapped. Resize is very slow on 
bidi platforms (Hebrew, Arabic) in the same scenario.
One optimization to speed up resizing the widget smaller would be to store not 
only the length of a line but also its width. We could then compare the line 
width against the new wrap width and skip lines that still fit. This would 
improve the performance when only a few lines actually need rewrapping based on 
a new, smaller widget width.

LK (7/9/2001 12:48:57 PM)
	Don't agree with the assessment above.  If we try to handle all problems that the user can cause when
	supplying their own content implementation, we'll introduce A LOT of overhead and complexity.
	I think it is correct to expect the user to take some responsiblity if they are providing their own
	content implementation.  Other SWT widgets certainly do not follow the approach above (e.g., 
	if you supply bogus info walkbacks/exceptions occur).

LK (7/9/2001 12:52:28 PM)
	DefaultContent is updated now to handle these special cases.  IllegalArgumentException will be
	thrown if the user attempts to do a bogus replace operation.  Other content implementors should
	do this or handle bogus replace operations correctly (i.e., answer the right number of new lines and
	replaced lines in the TextChanging callback data).

KR (7/9/01 1:48:12 PM)
	We could assume worst case behavior when getting/using data from StyledTextContent and 
	LineStyleListeners and catch StringIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions and 
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions. That's free and prevents us from failing badly (instead we
	will fail by rendering incorrectly or not rendering anything for example).

LK (7/9/01 5:07:17 PM)
	So if the TextChangingEvent has bogus information, basically any place that StyledText
	calls StyledTextContent for information needs to be considered a possible failure condition.  So
	all the places where methods like getLine(int), getLineAtOffset(int), getTextRange(int, int) are called
	would have to be wrapped with an exception handler.  I don't see any other way since we 
	can't make any assumptions about their implementation (e.g., what delimiters they are supporting,
	how they are storing their text).

	I really feel that we should not go down this path.  I also feel it is incorrect to ""hide"" the problems from 
	the user.  The place that these errors should be detected and handled should be in the StyledTextContent
	implementation.  Basically they are giving US bad information about THEIR data.  How can WE know that?"

		As of now, all badness has been removed from the text drawing 
and measuring

provide a small
		improvement across the board. The character conversion 
operation was sped
		up by 15 percent which is interesting because of its wide 
application. The
		improvement in text draw/measure was not significant however. :-
(

		We investigated adding in API to support painting/measuring 
substrings but
		found that the small improvement this would provide -- on our 
test machine, 
		23.78 microseconds to do a draw string versus 25.49 
microseconds to do one
		on a substring of the same size) did not warrent the 
propagation of new API.

		[Just for reference, the time to do a draw string (no 
substring) before any
		 of the current optimizations were made was 25.54 microseconds 
(versus
		 the current 23.78).]

		We have *not* tried switching to ExtTextOut yet. The risk 
factor for this is 
		quite high, since often the behavior does not match for the Ext
		APIs between platforms. We do not want to repeat the ""lines can 
not be

	In addition, it seems to incorrectly draw its background as light gray when in this state.

	and restoring the previously selected state when reenabling it.

When I create ActiveX wysiwyg HTML editing contol instance from workbnech

This is a problem to me, since to replace the file, I need to close VAJ
everytime,
and this is very time consumig process.

I do not know who is holding the handle but number of OleInitialize call
may not
balance to OleUninitialize in SWT. Could you investigate this problem?

	The problem is that OleInitialize is called when the COM class is 
loaded but OleUninitialize is never called.
	The reason OleUninitialize is not called is because there is no place 
in the COM class or anywhere else in
	the Ole stuff that can tell when all users of OLE have been disposed.
	The best solution is probably to move both OleInitialize and 
OleUninitialize into the Display class.

	I will attempt to produce a failing scenario.

BF (2001/04/11 08:03:48)
	Updated code with failing scenario.  Fails in build 0.042 / 0.042b.

VI (4/11/2001 9:51:27 AM)
	The failure is with Table.
	I believe what you are saying is that if you create a Table or TableTree with style FULL_SELECTION and click on any other column
	than the first column, this toggles the check box and sends the corresponding check box selection events.  Why are two events being sent?
	The following code demonstrates the problem:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Display display = new Display();
	Shell shell = new Shell(display);
	shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
	Table t = new Table(shell, SWT.FULL_SELECTION | SWT.CHECK);
	t.setHeaderVisible(true);

	String[] columnTitles = { ""Column 1"", ""Column 2"" };
     for (int i = 0; i < columnTitles.length; i++) {
     	TableColumn tableColumn = new TableColumn(t,SWT.NONE);
		tableColumn.setText(columnTitles[i]);
		tableColumn.setWidth(200);
     }

	for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
		TableItem item = new TableItem(t, SWT.NONE);
		item.setText(new String[]{""Item ""+j, ""Click here""});
	}

	t.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {
		public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
			System.out.println(""Item "" + ((Item) e.item).getText() + ""was selected with check  = "" + (e.detail == SWT.CHECK));

	The scroll bar does not shrink/disappear when you delete text because we only measure

Who is doing the resizing? The native widget or SWT?


NOTES:

VI (5/7/2001 4:59:14 PM)
	Are you inserting the image into a Table or a TableTree?

	In a Table all images must be the same size so the size is determined 
by the first image you insert - you may 
	wish to check the first image, maybe it is smaller than all the rest.

	In a TableTree, the first image that is inserted may be a +/- image to 
emulate the Tree appearance. If you insert an image into 
	a top level TableTreeItem before creating the very first sub item, than 
this image will determine the size of all images, otherwise, the 
	size of the +/- is determined by the font height.


	is determined by 

DG (5/7/2001 5:17:18 PM)
	Come to think of it, in all the cases I saw this problem, the widget 
was TableTree.
	All my images are standard 16x16 used throughout the workbench (and 
throughout
  	many MS applications), so we should probably do something about it. 
Resized 
	icons look pretty goofy.

	Now that you mentioned +/- image, many people noticed that it is larger 
than
	the equivalent +/- in the Tree widget (that too looks a bit goofy :-).

	Although I understand the need to handle variable font sizes, we have 
to 
	be able to handle this problem because virtually every plug-in that uses
	images use 16x16
	images everywhere.

	McQ (09/05/2001 3:51:22 PM) -
